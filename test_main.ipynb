(ii) what are the best practices to operate them? and (iii) how can the existing attacks/defenses be further improved?   to bridge this gap, we design and implement trojanzoo, the first open-source platform for evaluating neural backdoor attacks/defenses in a unified, holistic, and practical manner. thus far, focusing on the computer vision domain, it has incorporated 8 representative attacks, 14 state-of-the-art defenses, 6 attack performance metrics, 10 defense utility metrics, as well as rich tools for in-depth analysis of the attack-defense interactions. leveraging trojanzoo, we conduct a systematic study on the existing attacks/defenses, unveiling their complex design spectrum: both manifest intricate trade-offs among multiple desiderata (e.g., the effectiveness, evasiveness, and transferability of attacks). we further explore improving the existing attacks/defenses, leading to a number of interesting findings: (i) one-pixel triggers often suffice; (ii) training from scratch often outperforms perturbing benign models to craft trojan models; (iii) optimizing triggers and trojan models jointly greatly improves both attack effectiveness and evasiveness; (iv) individual defenses can often be evaded by adaptive attacks; and (v) exploiting model interpretability significantly improves defense robustness. we envision that trojanzoo will serve as a valuable platform to facilitate future research on neural backdoors.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'in this work, our goal is to train agents that can coordinate with seen, unseen as well as human partners in a multi-agent communication environment involving natural language. previous work using a single set of agents has shown great progress in generalizing to known partners, however it struggles when coordinating with unfamiliar agents. to mitigate that, recent work explored the use of population-based approaches, where multiple agents interact with each other with the goal of learning more generic protocols. these methods, while able to result in good coordination between unseen partners, still only achieve so in cases of simple languages, thus failing to adapt to human partners using natural language. we attribute this to the use of static populations and instead propose a dynamic population-based meta-learning approach that builds such a population in an iterative manner. we perform a holistic evaluation of our method on two different referential games, and show that our agents outperform all prior work when communicating with seen partners and humans. furthermore, we analyze the natural language generation skills of our agents, where we find that our agents also outperform strong baselines. finally, we test the robustness of our agents when communicating with out-of-population agents and carefully test the importance of each component of our method through ablation studies.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'this paper introduces a method for the detection of knock occurrences in an internal combustion engine (ice) using a 1d convolutional neural network trained on in-cylinder pressure data. the model architecture was based on considerations regarding the expected frequency characteristics of knocking combustion. to aid the feature extraction, all cycles were reduced to 60{\\\\deg} ca long windows, with no further processing applied to the pressure traces. the neural networks were trained exclusively on in-cylinder pressure traces from multiple conditions and labels provided by human experts. the best-performing model architecture achieves an accuracy of above 92% on all test sets in a tenfold cross-validation when distinguishing between knocking and non-knocking cycles. in a multi-class problem where each cycle was labeled by the number of experts who rated it as knocking, 78% of cycles were labeled perfectly, while 90% of cycles were classified at most one class from ground truth. they thus considerably outperform the broadly applied mapo (maximum amplitude of pressure oscillation) detection method, as well as other references reconstructed from previous works. our analysis indicates that the neural network learned physically meaningful features connected to engine-characteristic resonance frequencies, thus verifying the intended theory-guided data science approach. deeper performance investigation further shows remarkable generalization ability to unseen operating points. in addition, the model proved to classify knocking cycles in unseen engines with increased accuracy of 89% after adapting to their features via training on a small number of exclusively non-knocking cycles. the algorithm takes below 1 ms (on cpu) to classify individual cycles, effectively making it suitable for real-time engine control.',\n",

(ii) heterogeneity, interpreted at three levels: (ii-a) learning: psl considers heterogeneous number of stochastic gradient descent iterations with different mini-batch sizes at the devices; (ii-b) data: psl presumes a dynamic environment with data arrival and departure, where the distributions of local datasets evolve over time, captured via a new metric for model/concept drift. (ii-c) device: psl considers devices with different computation and communication capabilities. (iii) proximity, where devices have different distances to each other and the access point. psl considers the realistic scenario where global aggregations are conducted with idle times in-between them for resource efficiency improvements, and incorporates data dispersion and model dispersion with local model condensation into fedl. our analysis sheds light on the notion of cold vs. warmed up models, and model inertia in distributed machine learning. we then propose network-aware dynamic model tracking to optimize the model learning vs. resource efficiency tradeoff, which we show is an np-hard signomial programming problem. we finally solve this problem through proposing a general optimization solver. our numerical results reveal new findings on the interdependencies between the idle times in-between the global aggregations, model/concept drift, and d2d cooperation configuration.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'design of de novo biological sequences with desired properties, like protein and dna sequences, often involves an active loop with several rounds of molecule ideation and expensive wet-lab evaluations. these experiments can consist of multiple stages, with increasing levels of precision and cost of evaluation, where candidates are filtered. this makes the diversity of proposed candidates a key consideration in the ideation phase. in this work, we propose an active learning algorithm leveraging epistemic uncertainty estimation and the recently proposed gflownets as a generator of diverse candidate solutions, with the objective to obtain a diverse batch of useful (as defined by some utility function, for example, the predicted anti-microbial activity of a peptide) and informative candidates after each round. we also propose a scheme to incorporate existing labeled datasets of candidates, in addition to a reward function, to speed up learning in gflownets. we present empirical results on several biological sequence design tasks, and we find that our method generates more diverse and novel batches with high scoring candidates compared to existing approaches.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'elimination algorithms for bandit identification, which prune the plausible correct answers sequentially until only one remains, are computationally convenient since they reduce the problem size over time. however, existing elimination strategies are often not fully adaptive (they update their sampling rule infrequently) and are not easy to extend to combinatorial settings, where the set of answers is exponentially large in the problem dimension. on the other hand, most existing fully-adaptive strategies to tackle general identification problems are computationally demanding since they repeatedly test the correctness of every answer, without ever reducing the problem size. we show that adaptive methods can be modified to use elimination in both their stopping and sampling rules, hence obtaining the best of these two worlds: the algorithms (1) remain fully adaptive, (2) suffer a sample complexity that is never worse of their non-elimination counterpart, and (3) provably eliminate certain wrong answers early. we confirm these benefits experimentally, where elimination improves significantly the computational complexity of adaptive methods on common tasks like best-arm identification in linear bandits.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'reinforcement learning (rl) is frequently employed in fine-tuning large language models (lms), such as gpt-3, to penalize them for undesirable features of generated sequences, such as offensiveness, social bias, harmfulness or falsehood. the rl formulation involves treating the lm as a policy and updating it to maximise the expected value of a reward function which captures human preferences, such as non-offensiveness. in this paper, we analyze challenges associated with treating a language model as an rl policy and show how avoiding those challenges requires moving beyond the rl paradigm. we start by observing that the standard rl approach is flawed as an objective for fine-tuning lms because it leads to distribution collapse: turning the lm into a degenerate distribution. then, we analyze kl-regularised rl, a widely used recipe for fine-tuning lms, which additionally constrains the fine-tuned lm to stay close to its original distribution in terms of kullback-leibler (kl) divergence. we show that kl-regularised rl is equivalent to variational inference: approximating a bayesian posterior which specifies how to update a prior lm to conform with evidence provided by the reward function. we argue that this bayesian inference view of kl-regularised rl is more insightful than the typically employed rl perspective. the bayesian inference view explains how kl-regularised rl avoids the distribution collapse problem and offers a first-principles derivation for its objective. while this objective happens to be equivalent to rl (with a particular choice of parametric reward), there exist other objectives for fine-tuning lms which are no longer equivalent to rl. that observation leads to a more general point: rl is not an adequate formal framework for problems such as fine-tuning language models. these problems are best viewed as bayesian inference: approximating a pre-defined target distribution.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'online imitation learning is the problem of how best to mimic expert demonstrations, given access to the environment or an accurate simulator. prior work has shown that in the infinite sample regime, exact moment matching achieves value equivalence to the expert policy. however, in the finite sample regime, even if one has no optimization error, empirical variance can lead to a performance gap that scales with $h^2 / n$ for behavioral cloning and $h / \\\\sqrt{n}$ for online moment matching, where $h$ is the horizon and $n$ is the size of the expert dataset. we introduce the technique of replay estimation to reduce this empirical variance: by repeatedly executing cached expert actions in a stochastic simulator, we compute a smoother expert visitation distribution estimate to match. in the presence of general function approximation, we prove a meta theorem reducing the performance gap of our approach to the parameter estimation error for offline classification (i.e. learning the expert policy). in the tabular setting or with linear function approximation, our meta theorem shows that the performance gap incurred by our approach achieves the optimal $\\\\widetilde{o} \\\\left( \\\\min({h^{3/2}} / {n}, {h} / {\\\\sqrt{n}} \\\\right)$ dependency, under significantly weaker assumptions compared to prior work. we implement multiple instantiations of our approach on several continuous control tasks and find that we are able to significantly improve policy performance across a variety of dataset sizes.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'multi-fidelity modeling and learning are important in physical simulation-related applications. it can leverage both low-fidelity and high-fidelity examples for training so as to reduce the cost of data generation while still achieving good performance. while existing approaches only model finite, discrete fidelities, in practice, the fidelity choice is often continuous and infinite, which can correspond to a continuous mesh spacing or finite element length. in this paper, we propose infinite fidelity coregionalization (ifc). given the data, our method can extract and exploit rich information within continuous, infinite fidelities to bolster the prediction accuracy. our model can interpolate and/or extrapolate the predictions to novel fidelities, which can be even higher than the fidelities of training data. specifically, we introduce a low-dimensional latent output as a continuous function of the fidelity and input, and multiple it with a basis matrix to predict high-dimensional solution outputs. we model the latent output as a neural ordinary differential equation (ode) to capture the complex relationships within and integrate information throughout the continuous fidelities. we then use gaussian processes or another ode to estimate the fidelity-varying bases. for efficient inference, we reorganize the bases as a tensor, and use a tensor-gaussian variational posterior to develop a scalable inference algorithm for massive outputs. we show the advantage of our method in several benchmark tasks in computational physics.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"neural network models trained on text data have been found to encode undesirable linguistic or sensitive concepts in their representation. removing such concepts is non-trivial because of a complex relationship between the concept, text input, and the learnt representation. recent work has proposed post-hoc and adversarial methods to remove such unwanted concepts from a model's representation. through an extensive theoretical and empirical analysis, we show that these methods can be counter-productive: they are unable to remove the concepts entirely, and in the worst case may end up destroying all task-relevant features. the reason is the methods' reliance on a probing classifier as a proxy for the concept. even under the most favorable conditions for learning a probing classifier when a concept's relevant features in representation space alone can provide 100% accuracy, we prove that a probing classifier is likely to use non-concept features and thus post-hoc or adversarial methods will fail to remove the concept correctly. these theoretical implications are confirmed by experiments on models trained on synthetic, multi-nli, and twitter datasets. for sensitive applications of concept removal such as fairness, we recommend caution against using these methods and propose a spuriousness metric to gauge the quality of the final classifier.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'in performative prediction, a predictive model impacts the distribution that generates future data, a phenomenon that is being ignored in classical supervised learning. in this closed-loop setting, the natural measure of performance named performative risk ($\\\\mathrm{pr}$), captures the expected loss incurred by a predictive model \\\\emph{after} deployment. the core difficulty of using the performative risk as an optimization objective is that the data distribution itself depends on the model parameters. this dependence is governed by the environment and not under the control of the learner. as a consequence, even the choice of a convex loss function can result in a highly non-convex $\\\\mathrm{pr}$ minimization problem. prior work has identified a pair of general conditions on the loss and the mapping from model parameters to distributions that implies the convexity of the performative risk. in this paper, we relax these assumptions and focus on obtaining weaker notions of convexity, without sacrificing the amenability of the $\\\\mathrm{pr}$ minimization problem for iterative optimization methods.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'unlike vision and language data which usually has a unique format, molecules can naturally be characterized using different chemical formulations. one can view a molecule as a 2d graph or define it as a collection of atoms located in a 3d space. for molecular representation learning, most previous works designed neural networks only for a particular data format, making the learned models likely to fail for other data formats. we believe a general-purpose neural network model for chemistry should be able to handle molecular tasks across data modalities. to achieve this goal, in this work, we develop a novel transformer-based molecular model called transformer-m, which can take molecular data of 2d or 3d formats as input and generate meaningful semantic representations. using the standard transformer as the backbone architecture, transformer-m develops two separated channels to encode 2d and 3d structural information and incorporate them with the atom features in the network modules. when the input data is in a particular format, the corresponding channel will be activated, and the other will be disabled. by training on 2d and 3d molecular data with properly designed supervised signals, transformer-m automatically learns to leverage knowledge from different data modalities and correctly capture the representations. we conducted extensive experiments for transformer-m. all empirical results show that transformer-m can simultaneously achieve strong performance on 2d and 3d tasks, suggesting its broad applicability. the code and models will be made publicly available at https://github.com/lsj2408/transformer-m.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'timely and effective response to humanitarian crises requires quick and accurate analysis of large amounts of text data - a process that can highly benefit from expert-assisted nlp systems trained on validated and annotated data in the humanitarian response domain. to enable creation of such nlp systems, we introduce and release humset, a novel and rich multilingual dataset of humanitarian response documents annotated by experts in the humanitarian response community. the dataset provides documents in three languages (english, french, spanish) and covers a variety of humanitarian crises from 2018 to 2021 across the globe. for each document, humset provides selected snippets (entries) as well as assigned classes to each entry annotated using common humanitarian information analysis frameworks. humset also provides novel and challenging entry extraction and multi-label entry classification tasks. in this paper, we take a first step towards approaching these tasks and conduct a set of experiments on pre-trained language models (plm) to establish strong baselines for future research in this domain. the dataset is available at https://blog.thedeep.io/humset/.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"in the scope of drug discovery, the molecular design aims to identify novel compounds from the chemical space where the potential drug-like molecules are estimated to be in the order of 10^60 - 10^100. since this search task is computationally intractable due to the unbounded search space, deep learning draws a lot of attention as a new way of generating unseen molecules. as we seek compounds with specific target proteins, we propose a transformer-based deep model for de novo target-specific molecular design. the proposed method is capable of generating both drug-like compounds (without specified targets) and target-specific compounds. the latter are generated by enforcing different keys and values of the multi-head attention for each target. in this way, we allow the generation of smiles strings to be conditional on the specified target. experimental results demonstrate that our method is capable of generating both valid drug-like compounds and target-specific compounds. moreover, the sampled compounds from conditional model largely occupy the real target-specific molecules' chemical space and also cover a significant fraction of novel compounds.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'accurate high-altitude wind forecasting is important for air traffic control. and the large volume of data available for this task makes deep neural network-based models a possibility. however, special methods are required because the data is measured only sparsely: along the main aircraft trajectories and arranged sparsely in space, namely along the main air corridors. several deep learning approaches have been proposed, and in this work, we show that transformers can fit this data efficiently and are able to extrapolate coherently from a context set.   we show this by an extensive comparison of transformers to numerous existing deep learning-based baselines in the literature. besides high-altitude wind forecasting, we compare competing models on other dynamical physical systems, namely those modelled by partial differential equations, in particular the poisson equation and darcy flow equation. for these experiments, in the case where the data is arranged non-regularly in space, transformers outperform all the other evaluated methods. we also compared them in a more standard setup where the data is arranged on a grid and show that the transformers are competitive with state-of-the-art methods, even though it does not require regular spacing. the code and datasets of the different experiments will be made publicly available at publication time.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'modern neural networks are often quite wide, causing large memory and computation costs. it is thus of great interest to train a narrower network. however, training narrow neural nets remains a challenging task. we ask two theoretical questions: can narrow networks have as strong expressivity as wide ones? if so, does the loss function exhibit a benign optimization landscape? in this work, we provide partially affirmative answers to both questions for 1-hidden-layer networks with fewer than $n$ (sample size) neurons when the activation is smooth. first, we prove that as long as the width $m \\\\geq 2n/d$ (where $d$ is the input dimension), its expressivity is strong, i.e., there exists at least one global minimizer with zero training loss. second, we identify a nice local region with no local-min or saddle points. nevertheless, it is not clear whether gradient descent can stay in this nice region. third, we consider a constrained optimization formulation where the feasible region is the nice local region, and prove that every kkt point is a nearly global minimizer. it is expected that projected gradient methods converge to kkt points under mild technical conditions, but we leave the rigorous convergence analysis to future work. thorough numerical results show that projected gradient methods on this constrained formulation significantly outperform sgd for training narrow neural nets.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'diagnostic and prognostic models are increasingly important in medicine and inform many clinical decisions. recently, machine learning approaches have shown improvement over conventional modeling techniques by better capturing complex interactions between patient covariates in a data-driven manner. however, the use of machine learning introduces a number of technical and practical challenges that have thus far restricted widespread adoption of such techniques in clinical settings. to address these challenges and empower healthcare professionals, we present a machine learning framework, autoprognosis 2.0, to develop diagnostic and prognostic models. autoprognosis leverages state-of-the-art advances in automated machine learning to develop optimized machine learning pipelines, incorporates model explainability tools, and enables deployment of clinical demonstrators, without requiring significant technical expertise. our framework eliminates the major technical obstacles to predictive modeling with machine learning that currently impede clinical adoption. to demonstrate autoprognosis 2.0, we provide an illustrative application where we construct a prognostic risk score for diabetes using the uk biobank, a prospective study of 502,467 individuals. the models produced by our automated framework achieve greater discrimination for diabetes than expert clinical risk scores. our risk score has been implemented as a web-based decision support tool and can be publicly accessed by patients and clinicians worldwide. in addition, autoprognosis 2.0 is provided as an open-source python package. by open-sourcing our framework as a tool for the community, clinicians and other medical practitioners will be able to readily develop new risk scores, personalized diagnostics, and prognostics using modern machine learning techniques.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'health conditions among patients in intensive care units (icus) are monitored via electronic health records (ehrs), composed of numerical time series and lengthy clinical note sequences, both taken at irregular time intervals. dealing with such irregularity in every modality, and integrating irregularity into multimodal representations to improve medical predictions, is a challenging problem. in this paper, we address this problem by (1) modeling irregular time series by incorporating hand-crafted imputation embeddings into learned interpolation embeddings via a gating mechanism; (2) casting a series of clinical note representations as multivariate irregular time series and tackling irregularity via a time attention mechanism; and (3) fusing multimodalities with an interleaved attention mechanism across temporal steps to integrate irregularity into multimodal representations. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to thoroughly model irregularity in multimodalities and to take into account temporal knowledge in multimodal fusion, for improving medical predictions. the results on two medical prediction tasks show that our proposed methods outperform the state-of-the-art (sota) methods in both every single modality and multimodal fusion scenarios, illustrating the effectiveness of our methods and the value of modeling irregularity in multimodal fusion.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'generative adversarial network (gan) continues to be a popular research direction due to its high generation quality. it is observed that many state-of-the-art gans generate samples that are more similar to the training set than a holdout testing set from the same distribution, hinting some training samples are implicitly memorized in these models. this memorization behavior is unfavorable in many applications that demand the generated samples to be sufficiently distinct from known samples. nevertheless, it is unclear whether it is possible to reduce memorization without compromising the generation quality. in this paper, we propose memorization rejection, a training scheme that rejects generated samples that are near-duplicates of training samples during training. our scheme is simple, generic and can be directly applied to any gan architecture. experiments on multiple datasets and gan models validate that memorization rejection effectively reduces training sample memorization, and in many cases does not sacrifice the generation quality. code to reproduce the experiment results can be found at $\\\\texttt{https://github.com/jybai/mrgan}$.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"data-driven models, such as fourcastnet (fcn), have shown exemplary performance in high-resolution global weather forecasting. this performance, however, is based on supervision on mesh-gridded weather data without the utilization of raw climate observational data, the gold standard ground truth. in this work we develop a methodology to correct, remap, and fine-tune gridded uniform forecasts of fcn so it can be directly compared against observational ground truth, which is sparse and non-uniform in space and time. this is akin to bias correction and post-processing of numerical weather prediction (nwp), a routine operation at meteorological and weather forecasting centers across the globe. the adaptive fourier neural operator (afno) architecture is used as the backbone to learn continuous representations of the atmosphere. the spatially and temporally non-uniform output is evaluated by the non-uniform discrete inverse fourier transform (nuidft) given the output query locations. we call this network the deep-learning-corrector-remapper (dlcr). the improvement in dlcr's performance against the gold standard ground truth over the baseline's performance shows its potential to correct, remap, and fine-tune the mesh-gridded forecasts under the supervision of observations.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'graph-based fraud detection has heretofore received considerable attention. owning to the great success of graph neural networks (gnns), many approaches adopting gnns for fraud detection has been gaining momentum. however, most existing methods are based on the strong inductive bias of homophily, which indicates that the context neighbors tend to have same labels or similar features. in real scenarios, fraudsters often engage in camouflage behaviors in order to avoid detection system. therefore, the homophilic assumption no longer holds, which is known as the inconsistency problem. in this paper, we argue that the performance degradation is mainly attributed to the inconsistency between topology and attribute. to address this problem, we propose to disentangle the fraud network into two views, each corresponding to topology and attribute respectively. then we propose a simple and effective method that uses the attention mechanism to adaptively fuse two views which captures data-specific preference. in addition, we further improve it by introducing mutual information constraints for topology and attribute. to this end, we propose a disentangled information graph neural network (dignn) model, which utilizes variational bounds to find an approximate solution to our proposed optimization objective function. extensive experiments demonstrate that our model can significantly outperform stateof-the-art baselines on real-world fraud detection datasets.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'modeling and characterizing multiple factors is perhaps the most important step in achieving excess returns over market benchmarks. both academia and industry are striving to find new factors that have good explanatory power for future stock returns and good stability of their predictive power. in practice, factor investing is still largely based on linear multi-factor models, although many deep learning methods show promising results compared to traditional methods in stock trend prediction and portfolio risk management. however, the existing non-linear methods have two drawbacks: 1) there is a lack of interpretation of the newly discovered factors, 2) the financial insights behind the mining process are unclear, making practitioners reluctant to apply the existing methods to factor investing. to address these two shortcomings, we develop a novel deep multi-factor model that adopts industry neutralization and market neutralization modules with clear financial insights, which help us easily build a dynamic and multi-relational stock graph in a hierarchical structure to learn the graph representation of stock relationships at different levels, e.g., industry level and universal level. subsequently, graph attention modules are adopted to estimate a series of deep factors that maximize the cumulative factor returns. and a factor-attention module is developed to approximately compose the estimated deep factors from the input factors, as a way to interpret the deep factors explicitly. extensive experiments on real-world stock market data demonstrate the effectiveness of our deep multi-factor model in the task of factor investing.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'graph neural networks (gnns) have found successful applications in various graph-related tasks. however, recent studies have shown that many gnns are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. in a vast majority of existing studies, adversarial attacks on gnns are launched via direct modification of the original graph such as adding/removing links, which may not be applicable in practice. in this paper, we focus on a realistic attack operation via injecting fake nodes. the proposed global attack strategy via node injection (gani) is designed under the comprehensive consideration of an unnoticeable perturbation setting from both structure and feature domains. specifically, to make the node injections as imperceptible and effective as possible, we propose a sampling operation to determine the degree of the newly injected nodes, and then generate features and select neighbors for these injected nodes based on the statistical information of features and evolutionary perturbations obtained from a genetic algorithm, respectively. in particular, the proposed feature generation mechanism is suitable for both binary and continuous node features. extensive experimental results on benchmark datasets against both general and defended gnns show strong attack performance of gani. moreover, the imperceptibility analyses also demonstrate that gani achieves a relatively unnoticeable injection on benchmark datasets.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'recent deep learning is superior in providing high-quality images and ultra-fast reconstructions in accelerated magnetic resonance imaging (mri). faithful coil sensitivity estimation is vital for mri reconstruction. however, most deep learning methods still rely on pre-estimated sensitivity maps and ignore their inaccuracy, resulting in the significant quality degradation of reconstructed images. in this work, we propose a joint deep sensitivity estimation and image reconstruction network, called jdsi. during the image artifacts removal, it gradually provides more faithful sensitivity maps, leading to greatly improved image reconstructions. to understand the behavior of the network, the mutual promotion of sensitivity estimation and image reconstruction is revealed through the visualization of network intermediate results. results on in vivo datasets and radiologist reader study demonstrate that, the proposed jdsi achieves the state-of-the-art performance visually and quantitatively, especially when the accelerated factor is high. additionally, jdsi owns nice robustness to abnormal subjects and different number of autocalibration signals.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'the capacity to achieve out-of-distribution (ood) generalization is a hallmark of human intelligence and yet remains out of reach for machines. this remarkable capability has been attributed to our abilities to make conceptual abstraction and analogy, and to a mechanism known as indirection, which binds two representations and uses one representation to refer to the other. inspired by these mechanisms, we hypothesize that ood generalization may be achieved by performing analogy-making and indirection in the functional space instead of the data space as in current methods. to realize this, we design fine (functional indirection neural estimator), a neural framework that learns to compose functions that map data input to output on-the-fly. fine consists of a backbone network and a trainable semantic memory of basis weight matrices. upon seeing a new input-output data pair, fine dynamically constructs the backbone weights by mixing the basis weights. the mixing coefficients are indirectly computed through querying a separate corresponding semantic memory using the data pair. we demonstrate empirically that fine can strongly improve out-of-distribution generalization on iq tasks that involve geometric transformations. in particular, we train fine and competing models on iq tasks using images from the mnist, omniglot and cifar100 datasets and test on tasks with unseen image classes from one or different datasets and unseen transformation rules. fine not only achieves the best performance on all tasks but also is able to adapt to small-scale data scenarios.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'this paper focuses on complete dictionary learning problem, where the goal is to reparametrize a set of given signals as linear combinations of atoms from a learned dictionary. there are two main challenges faced by theoretical and practical studies of dictionary learning: the lack of theoretical guarantees for practically-used heuristic algorithms, and their poor scalability when dealing with huge-scale datasets. towards addressing these issues, we show that when the dictionary to be learned is orthogonal, that an alternating minimization method directly applied to the nonconvex and discrete formulation of the problem exactly recovers the ground truth. for the huge-scale, potentially online setting, we propose a minibatch version of our algorithm, which can provably learn a complete dictionary from a huge-scale dataset with minimal sample complexity, linear sparsity level, and linear convergence rate, thereby negating the need for any convex relaxation for the problem. our numerical experiments showcase the superiority of our method compared with the existing techniques when applied to tasks on real data.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'physics-informed neural networks (pinns) have become a kind of attractive machine learning method for obtaining solutions of partial differential equations (pdes). training pinns can be seen as a semi-supervised learning task, in which only exact values of initial and boundary points can be obtained in solving forward problems, and in the whole spatio-temporal domain collocation points are sampled without exact labels, which brings training difficulties. thus the selection of collocation points and sampling methods are quite crucial in training pinns. existing sampling methods include fixed and dynamic types, and in the more popular latter one, sampling is usually controlled by pde residual loss. we point out that it is not sufficient to only consider the residual loss in adaptive sampling and sampling should obey temporal causality. we further introduce temporal causality into adaptive sampling and propose a novel adaptive causal sampling method to improve the performance and efficiency of pinns. numerical experiments of several pdes with high-order derivatives and strong nonlinearity, including cahn hilliard and kdv equations, show that the proposed sampling method can improve the performance of pinns with few collocation points. we demonstrate that by utilizing such a relatively simple sampling method, prediction performance can be improved up to two orders of magnitude compared with state-of-the-art results with almost no extra computation cost, especially when points are limited.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'the problem of sequentially transferring from a source object track and a model to another bayesian filter has become ubiquitous. due to the lack of a structural model that can capture the dependence among different models, the transfer may not be fully specified. in this paper, we introduce a novel bayesian model that accounts for the model-jump from which the object can choose a model and follow. we aim to track the trajectory of the object while sequentially transferring from the source object to the target object. the main idea is to impute the dynamical model while tracking the object and estimating the state parameters of the moving object according to discretized dynamic systems. we demonstrate this procedure can handle the model mismatch as it sequentially corrects the predictive model. particularly, for a fixed number of motion models, the object can learn what motion to follow at each time step. we employ a prior model for each model and then adaptively correct for changing one model to another to robustly estimate object trajectory under various motions. more concretely, we propose a robust bayesian recipe to handle the model-jump and then integrate it with a markov chain monte carlo (mcmc) approach to sample from the posterior distribution. we demonstrate through experiments the advantage of accounting for model-jump in our proposed method for knowledge transfer between learning tasks in bayesian transfer learning.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"mass spectrometry imaging (msi), using traditional rectilinear scanning, takes hours to days for high spatial resolution acquisitions. given that most pixels within a sample's field of view are often neither relevant to underlying biological structures nor chemically informative, msi presents as a prime candidate for integration with sparse and dynamic sampling algorithms. during a scan, stochastic models determine which locations probabilistically contain information critical to the generation of low-error reconstructions. decreasing the number of required physical measurements thereby minimizes overall acquisition times. a deep learning approach for dynamic sampling (dlads), utilizing a convolutional neural network (cnn) and encapsulating molecular mass intensity distributions within a third dimension, demonstrates a simulated 70% throughput improvement for nanospray desorption electrospray ionization (nano-desi) msi tissues. evaluations are conducted between dlads and a supervised learning approach for dynamic sampling, with least-squares regression (slads-ls) and a multi-layer perceptron (mlp) network (slads-net). when compared with slads-ls, limited to a single m/z channel, as well as multichannel slads-ls and slads-net, dlads respectively improves regression performance by 36.7%, 7.0%, and 6.2%, resulting in gains to reconstruction quality of 6.0%, 2.1%, and 3.4% for acquisition of targeted m/z.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'despite impressive successes, deep reinforcement learning (rl) systems still fall short of human performance on generalization to new tasks and environments that differ from their training. as a benchmark tailored for studying rl generalization, we introduce avalon, a set of tasks in which embodied agents in highly diverse procedural 3d worlds must survive by navigating terrain, hunting or gathering food, and avoiding hazards. avalon is unique among existing rl benchmarks in that the reward function, world dynamics, and action space are the same for every task, with tasks differentiated solely by altering the environment; its 20 tasks, ranging in complexity from eat and throw to hunt and navigate, each create worlds in which the agent must perform specific skills in order to survive. this setup enables investigations of generalization within tasks, between tasks, and to compositional tasks that require combining skills learned from previous tasks. avalon includes a highly efficient simulator, a library of baselines, and a benchmark with scoring metrics evaluated against hundreds of hours of human performance, all of which are open-source and publicly available. we find that standard rl baselines make progress on most tasks but are still far from human performance, suggesting avalon is challenging enough to advance the quest for generalizable rl.',\n",

       "  'id': '2210.13435',\n",
       "  'abstract': \"future- or return-conditioned supervised learning is an emerging paradigm for offline reinforcement learning (rl), where the future outcome (i.e., return) associated with an observed action sequence is used as input to a policy trained to imitate those same actions. while return-conditioning is at the heart of popular algorithms such as decision transformer (dt), these methods tend to perform poorly in highly stochastic environments, where an occasional high return can arise from randomness in the environment rather than the actions themselves. such situations can lead to a learned policy that is inconsistent with its conditioning inputs; i.e., using the policy to act in the environment, when conditioning on a specific desired return, leads to a distribution of real returns that is wildly different than desired. in this work, we propose the dichotomy of control (doc), a future-conditioned supervised learning framework that separates mechanisms within a policy's control (actions) from those beyond a policy's control (environment stochasticity). we achieve this separation by conditioning the policy on a latent variable representation of the future, and designing a mutual information constraint that removes any information from the latent variable associated with randomness in the environment. theoretically, we show that doc yields policies that are consistent with their conditioning inputs, ensuring that conditioning a learned policy on a desired high-return future outcome will correctly induce high-return behavior. empirically, we show that doc is able to achieve significantly better performance than dt on environments that have highly stochastic rewards and transition\",\n",

       "  'abstract': \"metaformer, the abstracted architecture of transformer, has been found to play a significant role in achieving competitive performance. in this paper, we further explore the capacity of metaformer, again, without focusing on token mixer design: we introduce several baseline models under metaformer using the most basic or common mixers, and summarize our observations as follows: (1) metaformer ensures solid lower bound of performance. by merely adopting identity mapping as the token mixer, the metaformer model, termed identityformer, achieves >80% accuracy on imagenet-1k. (2) metaformer works well with arbitrary token mixers. when specifying the token mixer as even a random matrix to mix tokens, the resulting model randformer yields an accuracy of >81%, outperforming identityformer. rest assured of metaformer's results when new token mixers are adopted. (3) metaformer effortlessly offers state-of-the-art results. with just conventional token mixers dated back five years ago, the models instantiated from metaformer already beat state of the art. (a) convformer outperforms convnext. taking the common depthwise separable convolutions as the token mixer, the model termed convformer, which can be regarded as pure cnns, outperforms the strong cnn model convnext. (b) caformer sets new record on imagenet-1k. by simply applying depthwise separable convolutions as token mixer in the bottom stages and vanilla self-attention in the top stages, the resulting model caformer sets a new record on imagenet-1k: it achieves an accuracy of 85.5% at 224x224 resolution, under normal supervised training without external data or distillation. in our expedition to probe metaformer, we also find that a new activation, starrelu, reduces 71% flops of activation compared with gelu yet achieves better performance. we expect starrelu to find great potential in metaformer-like models alongside other neural networks.\",\n",
