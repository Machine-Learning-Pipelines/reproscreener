abstract = {This paper presents a reliability-based network design problem. A network reliability concept is embedded into the continuous network design problem in which travelers' route choice behavior follows the stochastic user equilibrium assumption. A new capacity-reliability index is introduced to measure the probability that all of the network links are operated below their capacities when serving different traffic patterns deviating from the average condition. The reliability-based network design problem is formulated as a bi-level program in which the lower level sub-program is the probit-based stochastic user equilibrium problem and the upper level sub-program is the maximization of the new capacity reliability index. The lower level sub-program is solved by a variant of the method of successive averages using the exponential average to represent the learning process of network users on a daily basis that results in the daily variation of traffic-flow pattern, and Monte Carlo stochastic loading. The upper level sub-program is tackled by means of genetic algorithms. A numerical example is used to demonstrate the concept of the proposed framework.},

abstract = {This paper demonstrates a cluster-based method to isolate influence in social network-based observational data, where "influence" is defined to mean that one person posts about a topic online and a second person posts about the same topic because he or she read the first post. Isolating influence in observational data is difficult, because we may observe that con-nected people discuss the same topic in proximate periods for reasons other than influence, in-cluding homophily–connected people are similar–and exogenous shock; they may have learned of the topic from some external source. We employ a matched sample estimation technique that has been used in the past to measure influence by controlling for demographic and usage based homophily, and add to the matching scheme a cluster ID. Our contribution is two-fold: First, we provide preliminary evidence that social network-based clusters capture homophily, indicating that a network-based attribute approach may not only capture homophily but also may be used in lieu of using demographic attributes for matching similar users in scenarios when privacy preservation is a concern. Second, we show that by adding a network position attribute, a cluster ID, when matching similar users, we can isolate influence better. We be-lieve that our approach to isolate influence can have a broad impact on problems where social networks and associated behaviors can be observed over time.},

abstract = {When an initial failure of nodes occurs in interdependent networks, a cascade of failure between the networks occurs. Earlier studies focused on random initial failures. Here we study the robustness of interdependent networks under targeted attack on high or low degree nodes. We introduce a general technique which maps the targeted-attack problem in interdependent networks to the random-attack problem in a transformed pair of interdependent networks. We find that when the highly connected nodes are protected and have lower probability to fail, in contrast to single scale-free (SF) networks where the percolation threshold pc = 0, coupled SF networks are significantly more vulnerable with pc significantly larger than zero. The result implies that interdependent networks are difficult to defend by strategies such as protecting the high degree nodes that have been found useful to significantly improve robustness of single networks.},

abstract = {Advanced computer vision and machine learning techniques tried to automatically categorize the emotions elicited by abstract paintings with limited success. Since the annotation of the emotional content is highly resourceconsuming, datasets of abstract paintings are either constrained in size or partially annotated. Consequently, it is natural to address the targeted task within a transductive framework. Intuitively, the use of multi-label classification techniques is desirable so to synergically exploit the relations between multiple latent variables, such as emotional content, technique, author, etc. A very popular approach for transductive multi-label recognition under linear classification settings is matrix completion. In this study we introduce non-linear matrix completion (NLMC), thus extending classical linear matrix completion techniques to the non-linear case. Together with the theory grounding the model, we propose an efficient optimization solver. As shown by our extensive experimental validation on two publicly available datasets, NLMC outperforms state-of-the-art methods when recognizing emotions from abstract paintings.},

abstract = {Continuous-time Markov process models of contagions are widely studied, not least because of their utility in predicting the evolution of real-world contagions and in formulating control measures. It is often the case, however, that discrete-time approaches are employed to analyze such models or to simulate them numerically. In such cases, time is discretized into uniform steps and transition rates between states are replaced by transition probabilities. In this paper, we illustrate potential limitations to this approach. We show how discretizing time leads to a restriction on the values of the model parameters that can accurately be studied. We examine numerical simulation schemes employed in the literature, showing how synchronous-type updating schemes can bias discrete-time formalisms when compared against continuous-time formalisms. Event-based simulations, such as the Gillespie algorithm, are proposed as optimal simulation schemes both in terms of replicating the continuous-time process and computational speed. Finally, we show how discretizing time can affect the value of the epidemic threshold for large values of the infection rate and the recovery rate, even if the ratio between the former and the latter is small.},

abstract = {Given a graph $G=(V,E)$ with two distinguished vertices $s,t\in V$ and an integer parameter $L>0$, an $L$-bounded cut is a subset $F$ of edges (nodes) such that the every path between $s$ and $t$ in $G\setminus F$ has length more than $L$. The task is to find an $L$-bounded cut of minimum cardinality. Though the problem is very simple to state and has been studied since the beginning of the 70's, it is not much understood yet. The problem is known to be $\cal{NP}$-hard to approximate within a small constant factor even for $L\geq 4$ (for $L\geq 5$ for the node cuts). On the other hand, the best known approximation algorithm for general graphs has approximation ratio only $\mathcal{O}({n^{2/3}})$ in the edge case, and $\mathcal{O}({\sqrt{n}})$ in the node case, where $n$ denotes the number of nodes. We show that for planar graphs, it is possible to solve both the edge- and the node-version of the problem optimally in time $\mathcal{O}(L^{3L}n)$. That is, the problem is fixed parameter tractable (FPT) with respect to $L$ on planar graphs. Furthermore, we show that the problem remains FPT even for bounded genus graphs, a super class of planar graphs. Our second contribution is an $\mathcal{O}(\tau\sqrt{\log \tau}\log n)$-approximation algorithm for the node version of the problem on graphs with treewidth bounded by $\tau$. For graphs with treewidth bounded by $\mathcal{O}(n^{1/2-\epsilon})$ for any $\epsilon>0$, but not by a constant, this is the best approximation in terms of$\sim$$n$ that we are aware of.},

Our procedure is based on the classic probabilistic result, the birthday paradox. When the transitivity is constant and there are more edges than wedges (common properties for social networks), we can prove that our algorithm requires $O(\sqrt{n})$ space ($n$ is the number of vertices) to provide accurate estimates. We run a detailed set of experiments on a variety of real graphs and demonstrate that the memory requirement of the algorithm is a tiny fraction of the graph. For example, even for a graph with 200 million edges, our algorithm stores just 60,000 edges to give accurate results. Being a single pass streaming algorithm, our procedure also maintains a real-time estimate of the transitivity/number of triangles of a graph, by storing a minuscule fraction of edges.},

Unlike the traditional DL and SC framework, our new formulation {\it does not explicitly incorporate any sparsity inducing norm in the cost function but yet yields SCs}. Moreover, we extend this framework to the manifold of symmetric positive definite matrices, $\mathcal{P}_n$. Our algorithm approximates the data points, which are probability distributions, by the weighted Kullback-Leibeler center (KL-center) of the dictionary atoms. The KL-center is the minimizer of the maximum KL-divergence between the unknown center and members of the set whose center is being sought. Further, {\it we proved that this KL-center is a sparse combination of the dictionary atoms}. Since, the data reside on a statistical manifold, the data fidelity term can not be as simple as in the case of the vector-space data. We therefore employ the geodesic distance between the data and a sparse approximation of the data element. This cost function is minimized using an acceleterated gradient descent algorithm. An extensive set of experimental results show the effectiveness of our proposed framework. We present several experiments involving a variety of classification problems in Computer Vision applications. Further, we demonstrate the performance of our algorithm by comparing it to several state-of-the-art methods both in terms of classification accuracy and sparsity.},

A simple and computationally cheap algorithm for this is stochastic gradient descent (SGD), which incrementally updates its estimate based on each new data point. However, due to the non-convex nature of the problem, analyzing its performance has been a challenge. In particular, existing guarantees rely on a non-trivial eigengap assumption on the covariance matrix, which is intuitively unnecessary. In this paper, we provide (to the best of our knowledge) the first eigengap-free convergence guarantees for SGD in the context of PCA. This also partially resolves an open problem posed in (Hardt & Price, #y2014). Moreover, under an eigengap assumption, we show that the same techniques lead to new SGD convergence guarantees with better dependence on the eigengap.},

Due to the rapid growing number of real-time internet applications developed since the last decade, the discovery of topology weakness related to its quality of service (QoS) is of more interest. In this paper, we provide a novel QoS-aware measurement for assessing the vulnerability of general network topologies. Specifically, we evaluate the vulnerability by detecting the minimum number of link failures that decrease the satisfactory level of the QoS-Optimal source-destination path to a given value, which means a topology with a smaller amount of such link failures is more vulnerable. We formulate this process as a graph optimization problem called QoSCE and provide several exact and heuristic algorithms for various QoS constraint amounts. To our best knowledge, this is the first graph-theoretical framework to evaluate QoS-aware topology vulnerability. Through extensive simulations, the performance of the proposed algorithms are validated in terms of assessment accuracy and time complexity.},

Here we perform an integrative study of Zea mays (maize) seed development in order to identify key genes in a complex developmental process. First, we reverse engineered a GRN from 78 maize seed transcriptome profiles. Then, we studied collective gene interaction patterns and uncovered highly interwoven network communities as the building blocks of the GRN. One community, composed of mostly unknown genes interacting with opaque2, brittle endosperm1 and shrunken2, contributes to seed phenotypes. Another community, composed mostly of genes expressed in the basal endosperm transfer layer, is responsible for nutrient transport. We further integrated our inferred GRN with gene expression patterns in different seed compartments and at various developmental stages and pathways. The integration facilitated a biological interpretation of the GRN. Our yeast one-hybrid assays verified six out of eight TF-promoter bindings in the reconstructed GRN. This study identified topologically important genes in interwoven network communities that may be crucial to maize seed development.},

We propose the first algorithm for this problem that achieves a tight $(1/2-\varepsilon)$-approximation guarantee using $\tilde{O}(\varepsilon^{-1})$ adaptive rounds and a linear number of function evaluations. No previously known algorithm for this problem achieves an approximation ratio better than $1/3$ using less than $\Omega(n)$ rounds of adaptivity, where $n$ is the size of the ground set. Moreover, our algorithm easily extends to the maximization of a non-negative continuous DR-submodular function subject to a box constraint and achieves a tight $(1/2-\varepsilon)$-approximation guarantee for this problem while keeping the same adaptive and query complexities.},

The key idea behind COSMA is to derive an optimal (up to a factor of 0.03% for 10MB of fast memory) sequential schedule and then parallelize it, preserving I/O optimality. To achieve this, we use the red-blue pebble game to precisely model MMM dependencies and derive a constructive and tight sequential and parallel I/O lower bound proofs. Compared to 2D or 3D algorithms, which fix processor decomposition upfront and then map it to the matrix dimensions, it reduces communication volume by up to √; times. COSMA outperforms the established ScaLAPACK, CARMA, and CTF algorithms in all scenarios up to 12.8x (2.2x on average), achieving up to 88% of Piz Daint's peak performance. Our work does not require any hand tuning and is maintained as an open source implementation.},

abstract = {An instance of the generalized partial cover problem consists of a ground set U and a family of subsets S ⊆ 2 U . Each element e ∈ U is associated with a profit p(e), whereas each subset S ∈ S has a cost c(S). The objective is to find a minimum cost subcollection S ⊆ S such that the combined profit of the elements covered by S is at least P , a specified profit bound. In the prize-collecting version of this problem, there is no strict requirement to cover any element; however, if the subsets we pick leave an element e ∈ U uncovered, we incur a penalty of $\pi$(e). The goal is to identify a subcollection S ⊆ S that minimizes the cost of S plus the penalties of uncovered elements. Although problem-specific connections between the partial cover and the prize-collecting vari-ants of a given covering problem have been explored and exploited, a more general connection remained open. The main contribution of this paper is to establish a formal relationship between these two variants. As a result, we present a unified framework for approximating problems that can be formulated or interpreted as special cases of generalized partial cover. We demonstrate the applicability of our method on a diverse collection of covering problems, for some of which we obtain the first non-trivial approximability results.},

While there are strong theoretical guarantees on the performance of Greedy for maximizing submodular functions, there are few guarantees for non-submodular ones. However, Greedy enjoys strong empirical performance for many important non-submodular functions, e.g., the Bayesian A-optimality objective in experimental design. We prove theoretical guarantees supporting the empirical performance. Our guarantees are characterized by the (generalized) submodularity ratio $\gamma$ and the (generalized) curvature $\alpha$. In particular, we prove that Greedy enjoys a tight approximation guarantee of $\frac{1}{\alpha}(1- e^{-\gamma\alpha})$ for cardinality constrained maximization. In addition, we bound the submodularity ratio and curvature for several important real-world objectives, e.g., the Bayesian A-optimality objective, the determinantal function of a square submatrix and certain linear programs with combinatorial constraints. We experimentally validate our theoretical findings for several real-world applications.},

However, the functional significance of Arc in schizophrenia-related neurobehavioral phenotypes and brain circuits is unclear. Here, we find that, consistent with schizophrenia-related phenotypes, disruption of Arc in mice produces deficits in sensorimotor gating, cognitive functions, social behaviors, and amphetamine-induced psychomotor responses. Furthermore, genetic disruption of Arc leads to concomitant hypoactive mesocortical and hyperactive mesostriatal dopamine pathways. Application of a D1 agonist to the prefrontal cortex or a D2 antagonist in the ventral striatum rescues Arc-dependent cognitive or psychomotor abnormalities, respectively. Our findings demonstrate a role for Arc in the regulation of dopaminergic neurotransmission and related behaviors. The results also provide initial biological support implicating Arc in dopaminergic and behavioral abnormalities related to schizophrenia.

Due to their importance, viral marketing related problems in OSNs have been extensively studied in the past decade. However, none of the existing works can cope with the situation that the propagation rate dynamically increases for popular topics, as they all assume known propagation rates. In this paper, to better describe realistic information propagation in OSNs, we propose a novel model, Dynamic Influence Propagation (DIP), that allows propagation rate to change during the diffusion. We then define a new research problem: Threshold Activation Problem under DIP (TAP-DIP) to study the impact of DIP. TAP-DIP adds extra complexity on the already #P-hard TAP problem. Despite it hardness, we are able to approximate TAP-DIP with O(log|V|) ratio. Sitting in the core of our algorithm are the Lipschitz optimization technique and a novel solution to the general version of TAP, the Multi-TAP problem. Using various real OSN datasets, we experimentally demonstrate the impact of DIP and that our solution not only generates high-quality seed sets when being aware of the rate increase, but also is scalable.},

abstract = {Many machine learning problems reduce to the problem of minimizing an expected risk, defined as the sum of a large number of, often convex, component functions. Iterative gradient methods are popular techniques for the above problems. However, they are in general slow to converge, in particular for large data sets. In this work, we develop analysis for selecting a subset (or sketch) of training data points with their corresponding learning rates in order to provide faster convergence to a close neighbordhood of the optimal solution. We show that subsets that minimize the upper-bound on the estimation error of the full gradient, maximize a submodular facility location function. As a result, by greedily maximizing the facility location function we obtain subsets that yield faster convergence to a close neighborhood of the optimum solution. We demonstrate the real-world effectiveness of our algorithm, SIG, confirming our analysis, through an extensive set of experiments on several applications, including logistic regression and training neural networks. We also include a method that provides a deliberate deterministic ordering of the data subset that is quite effective in practice. We observe that our method, while achieving practically the same loss, speeds up gradient methods by up to 10x for convex and 3x for non-convex (deep) functions.},

abstract = {A repetitive sequence collection is a set of sequences which are small variations of each other. A prominent example are genome sequences of individuals of the same or close species, where the differences can be expressed by short lists of basic edit operations. Flexible and efficient data analysis on such a typically huge collection is plausible using suffix trees. However, the suffix tree occupies much space, which very soon inhibits in-memory analyses. Recent advances in full-text indexing reduce the space of the suffix tree to, essentially, that of the compressed sequences, while retaining its functionality with only a polylogarithmic slowdown. However, the underlying compression model considers only the predictability of the next sequence symbol given the k previous ones, where k is a small integer. This is unable to capture longer-term repetitiveness. For example, r identical copies of an incompressible sequence will be incompressible under this model. We develop new static and dynamic full-text indexes that are able of capturing the fact that a collection is highly repetitive, and require space basically proportional to the length of one typical sequence plus the total number of edit operations. The new indexes can be plugged into a recent dynamic fully-compressed suffix tree, achieving full functionality for sequence analysis, while retaining the reduced space and the polylogarithmic slowdown. Our experimental results confirm the practicality of our proposal.},

The cost of the update operations depends on the class of the considered graph and on the number of the output updates, i.e., on the number of vertices that, due to an edge modification, either change the distance from the source or change the parent in the shortest paths tree. We first show that, if we deal only with updates on the weights of edges, then the update procedures require O(logn) worst case time per output update for several classes of graphs, as in the case of graphs with bounded genus, bounded arboricity, bounded degree, bounded treewidth, and bounded pagenumber.

Simply scaling up established bioinformatics pipelines will not be sufficient for leveraging the full potential of such rich genomic data sets. Instead, novel, qualitatively different computational methods and paradigms are needed. We will witness the rapid extension of computational pan-genomics, a new sub-area of research in computational biology. In this article, we generalize existing definitions and understand a pan-genome as any collection of genomic sequences to be analyzed jointly or to be used as a reference. We examine already available approaches to construct and use pan-genomes, discuss the potential benefits of future technologies and methodologies and review open challenges from the vantage point of the above-mentioned biological disciplines. As a prominent example for a computational paradigm shift, we particularly highlight the transition from the representation of reference genomes as strings to representations as graphs. We outline how this and other challenges from different application domains translate into common computational problems, point out relevant bioinformatics techniques and identify open problems in computer science. With this review, we aim to increase awareness that a joint approach to computational pan-genomics can help address many of the problems currently faced in various domains.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 IEEE. Motivated by the relevance of clustering or transitivity to a variety of network applications, we study the Triangle Interdiction Problem (TIP), which is to find a minimum-size set of edges that intersects all triangles of a network. As existing approximation algorithms for this NP-hard problem either do not scale well to massive networks or have poor solution quality, we formulate two algorithms, TARL and DART, with worst-case guarantees 5/2 and 3 with respect to optimal, respectively. Furthermore, DART is able to efficiently maintain its worst-case guarantee under dynamic edge insertion and removal to the network. In our comprehensive experimental evaluation, we demonstrate that DART is able to run on networks with billions of triangles within 2 hours and is able to dynamically update its solution in microseconds.},

abstract = {Information diffusion and virus propagation are fundamental processes taking place in networks. While it is often possible to directly observe when nodes become infected with a virus or adopt the information, observing individual transmissions (i.e., who infects whom, or who influences whom) is typically very difficult. Furthermore, in many applications, the underlying network over which the diffusions and propagations spread is actually unobserved. We tackle these challenges by developing a method for tracing paths of diffusion and influence through networks and inferring the networks over which contagions propagate. Given the times when nodes adopt pieces of information or become infected, we identify the optimal network that best explains the observed infection times. Since the optimization problem is NP-hard to solve exactly, we develop an efficient approximation algorithm that scales to large datasets and finds provably near-optimal networks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by tracing information diffusion in a set of 170 million blogs and news articles over a one year period to infer how information flows through the online media space. We find that the diffusion network of news for the top 1,000 media sites and blogs tends to have a core-periphery structure with a small set of core media sites that diffuse information to the rest of the Web. These sites tend to have stable circles of influence with more general news media sites acting as connectors between them.},

A recent study by Onnela et al uncovered the weak ties effects in mobile communication. In this paper, we provide complementary results on document networks, that is, the edges connecting less similar nodes in content are more significant in maintaining the global connectivity. We propose an index called bridgeness to quantify the edge significance in maintaining connectivity, which only depends on local information of the network topology. We compare the bridgeness with content similarity and some other structural indices according to an edge percolation process. Experimental results on document networks show that the bridgeness outperforms content similarity in characterizing the edge significance. Furthermore, extensive numerical results on disparate networks indicate that the bridgeness is also better than some well-known indices on edge significance, including the Jaccard coefficient, degree product and betweenness centrality.},

abstract = { In the future automated battle field communications will be supported in part by a hierarchical wireless network that includes: ad hoc ground radio subnets; point to point wireless long haul backbone, and; unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). In such a hierarchical network, nodes are generally partitioned into groups. Each group has one or more backbone nodes that provide access points to the backbone network and to UAVs. Communications between groups can thus utilize links at higher level. A critical protocol in the operation of such a large mobile network is routing. Previous research of UAV based systems has generally assumed the use of a hierarchical routing scheme, for example, extended hierarchical state routing (EHSR). However, a hierarchical scheme like EHSR has some limitations. In this paper, we extend landmark ad hoc routing (LANMAR) to a hierarchical structure with backbone nodes, high quality backbone links and UAVs. We show that the basic LANMAR scheme can be extended to incorporate backbone and UAV links. We will also show how backbone links and UAV links are automatically discovered by the LANMAR routing algorithm and are used effectively to reach remote destinations (thus reducing the hop distance). In other words, our scheme will combine the benefits of "flat" LANMAR routing and physical network hierarchy, without suffering of the intrinsic EHSR limitations.},

One consequence of our result is that the linear-time STOCHASTIC-GREEDY algorithm recently proposed in (Mirzasoleiman et al.,2015) achieves the optimal running time while maintaining an optimal approximation guarantee. We also show that high probability guarantees cannot be obtained for stochastic greedy algorithms under matroid constraints, and prove an approximation guarantee which holds in expectation.

abstract = {Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) provide a representation of relationships between regulators and their target genes. Several methods for GRNinference, both unsupervised and supervised, have been developed to date. Because regulatory relationships consistently reprogram in diverse tissues or under different conditions, GRNs inferred without specific biological contexts are of limited applicability. In this report, a machine learning approach is presented to predict GRNs specific to developing Arabidopsis thaliana embryos. We developed the Beacon GRN inference tool to predict GRNs occurring during seed development in Arabidopsis based on a support vector machine (SVM) model. We developed both global and local inference models and compared their performance, demonstrating that local models are generally superior for our application. Using both the expression levels of the genes expressed in developing embryos and prior known regulatory relationships, GRNs were predicted for specific embryonic developmental stages. The targets that are strongly positively correlated with their regulators are mostly expressed at the beginning of seed development. Potential direct targets were identified based on a match between the promoter regions of these inferred targets and the cis elements recognized by specific regulators. Our analysis also provides evidence for previously unknown inhibitory effects of three positive regulators of gene expression. The Beacon GRN inference tool provides a valuable model system for context-specific GRN inference and is freely available at https://github.com/BeaconProjectAtVirginiaTech/beacon_network_inference.git.},

abstract = {—For the purpose of propagating information and ideas through a social network, a seeding strategy aims to find a small set of seed users that are able to maximize the spread of the influence, which is termed as influence maximization problem. Despite a large number of works have studied this problem, the existing seeding strategies are limited to the static social networks. In fact, due to the high speed data transmission and the large population of participants, the diffusion processes in real-world social networks have many aspects of uncertainness. Unfortunately, as shown in the experiments, in such cases the state-of-art seeding strategies are pessimistic as they fails to trace the dynamic changes in a social network. In this paper, we study the strategies selecting seed users in an adaptive manner. We first formally model the Dynamic Independent Cascade model and introduce the concept of adaptive seeding strategy. Then based on the proposed model, we show that a simple greedy adaptive seeding strategy finds an effective solution with a provable performance guarantee. Besides the greedy algorithm an efficient heuristic algorithm is provided in order to meet practical requirements. Extensive experiments have been performed on both the real-world networks and synthetic power-law networks. The results herein demonstrate the superiority of the adaptive seeding strategies to other standard methods.

In this paper we present a general framework to describe and study multiplex networks, whose links are either unweighted or weighted. In particular we propose a series of measures to characterize the multiplexicity of the systems in terms of: i) basic node and link properties such as the node degree, and the edge overlap and reinforcement, ii) local properties such as the clustering coefficient and the transitivity, iii) global properties related to the navigability of the multiplex across the different layers.

abstract = {The Feedback Vertex Set problem (FVS), where the goal is to find a small subset of vertices that intersects every cycle in an input directed graph, is among the fundamental problems whose approximability is not well-understood. One can efficiently find an O(logn) factor approximation, and while a constant-factor approximation is ruled out under the Unique Games Conjecture (UGC), the best NP-hardness result is only a factor of about 1.36 (via a simple reduction from Vertex Cover). This work studies a natural variant of the Feedback Vertex Set problem (FVS), where the goal is to find a small subset of vertices that intersects every cycle of *bounded length*. For this variant, we prove strong *NP-hardness* of approximation results: For any integer constant k3 and 0, it is hard to find a (k−1−)-approximate solution to the problem of intersecting every cycle of length at most k. The hardness result almost matches the trivial factor k approximation algorithm for the problem. In fact, the hardness holds also for the problem of hitting every cycle of length at most a parameter kk where k can be taken to be (lognloglogn). Taking k=(lognloglogn) would be enough to prove a hardness for FVS (for arbitrary length cycles). Our work thus identifies the problem of hitting cycles of length logn as the key towards resolving the approximability of FVS. Our result is based on reductions from k-uniform Hypergraph Vertex Cover with random matching and labeling techniques. As byproducts of our techniques, we also prove a factor (k−1−) hardness of approximation result for k-Clique Transversal, where one must hit every k-clique in the graph with fewest possible vertices, and a factor (k) hardness result for finding a minimum-sized set of *edges* to hit all k-cycles. We also obtain almost tight (k) factor hardness results for the dual problem of packing vertex-disjoint k-cycles and k-cliques in a graph, albeit relying on the UGC for k-Cycle Packing (but we do get a weaker factor (k) NP-hardness result).},

abstract = {The whole frame of interconnections in complex networks hinges on a specific set of structural nodes, much smaller than the total size, which, if activated, would cause the spread of information to the whole network, or, if immunized, would prevent the diffusion of a large scale epidemic. Localizing this optimal, that is, minimal, set of structural nodes, called influencers, is one of the most important problems in network science. Despite the vast use of heuristic strategies to identify influential spreaders, the problem remains unsolved. Here we map the problem onto optimal percolation in random networks to identify the minimal set of influencers, which arises by minimizing the energy of a many-body system, where the form of the interactions is fixed by the non-backtracking matrix of the network. Big data analyses reveal that the set of optimal influencers is much smaller than the one predicted by previous heuristic centralities. Remarkably, a large number of previously neglected weakly connected nodes emerges among the optimal influencers. These are topologically tagged as low-degree nodes surrounded by hierarchical coronas of hubs, and are uncovered only through the optimal collective interplay of all the influencers in the network. The present theoretical framework may hold a larger degree of universality, being applicable to other hard optimization problems exhibiting a continuous transition from a known phase.},

Here we provide a solution to this conundrum, showing that the stability of a system of networks relies on the relation between the internal structure of a network and its pattern of connections to other networks. Specifically, we demonstrate that if interconnections are provided by network hubs, and the connections between networks are moderately convergent, the system of networks is stable and robust to failure. We test this theoretical prediction on two independent experiments of functional brain networks (in task and resting states), which show that brain networks are connected with a topology that maximizes stability according to the theory},

abstract = {Models of networked diffusion that are motivated by analogy with the spread of infectious disease have been applied to a wide range of social and economic adoption processes, including those related to new products, ideas, norms and behaviors. However, it is unknown how accurately these models account for the empirical structure of diffusion over networks. Here we describe the diffusion patterns arising from seven online domains, ranging from communications platforms to networked games to microblogging services, each involving distinct types of content and modes of sharing.We find strikingly similar patterns across all domains. In particular, the vast majority of cascades are small, and are described by a handful of simple tree structures that terminate within one degree of an initial adopting “seed.” In addition we find that structures other than these account for only a tiny fraction of total adoptions; that is, adoptions resulting from chains of referrals are extremely rare. Finally, even for the largest cascades that we observe, we find that the bulk of adoptions often takes place within one degree of a few dominant individuals. Together, these observations suggest new directions for modeling of online adoption processes.},

Half of the names had previously been judged to be of high familiarity (e.g., Gwyneth Paltrow), and half were of lower familiarity (e.g., Billy Bob Thornton). The results showed that when in a tip-of-the-tongue (TOT) state, the participants were able to estimate at above-chance rates whether a celebrity's name comprised two or three words. Accurate information about the number of words was not available to the participants unless they were in a TOT state or had already named the person. Attempts to identify celebrities whose name had three elements were associated with an increased number of TOTs, relative to celebrities whose name had two units, but there was no difference in the number of don't know responses for names containing two or three words. Calculations based on Gollan and Brown (2006) suggested that having three names impaired the phonological but not the semantic stage of lexical retrieval, whereas low familiarity impaired both semantic and phonological retrieval stages.},

abstract = {Networks of living neurons exhibit diverse patterns of activity, including oscillations, synchrony, and waves. Recent work in physics has shown yet another mode of activity in systems composed of many nonlinear units interacting locally. For example, avalanches, earthquakes, and forest fires all propagate in systems organized into a critical state in which event sizes show no characteristic scale and are described by power laws. We hypothesized that a similar mode of activity with complex emergent properties could exist in networks of cortical neurons. We investigated this issue in mature organotypic cultures and acute slices of rat cortex by recording spontaneous local field potentials continuously using a 60 channel multielectrode array. Here, we show that propagation of spontaneous activity in cortical networks is described by equations that govern avalanches. As predicted by theory for a critical branching process, the propagation obeys a power law with an exponent of -3/2 for event sizes, with a branching parameter close to the critical value of 1. Simulations show that a branching parameter at this value optimizes information transmission in feedforward networks, while preventing runaway network excitation. Our findings suggest that "neuronal avalanches" may be a generic property of cortical networks, and represent a mode of activity that differs profoundly from oscillatory, synchronized, or wave-like network states. In the critical state, the network may satisfy the competing demands of information transmission and network stability.},

abstract = {The eigenvector centrality has been traditionally used to quantify the importance of a node in a network. The main contribution of the eigenvector centrality is that it takes into account the importance of the node's neighbours by giving a score to the node that is proportional to the scores of all its connected nodes. In this way, the mathematical definition of the eigenvector centrality x k of a node k is related to an iterative process were the centrality is calculated as the sum of the centralities of its neighbours: x k = $\gamma$ −1 j G kj x j , (1) where $\gamma$ is a constant, x k is the eigenvector centrality of node k and G kj are the components of the adjacency matrix. In matrix notation Eq. S1 reads $\gamma$ x = G x so that x can be expressed as a linear combination of the eigenvectors v k of the adjacency matrix G, being $\gamma$ k the set of the corresponding eigenvalues. Note that Eq. S1 can be regarded as an iterative process that begins at t = 0 with a set of initial conditions x 0 . No matter what the values of x 0 are, the value of x k (t) at t → ∞ will be proportional to the eigenvector v 1 associated to the dominant eigenvalue $\gamma$ 1 . Therefore, the eigenvector centrality is directly obtained from the eigenvector v 1 of the adjacency matrix G. The concept of eigenvector centrality can be easily extended to weighted connectivity matrices, where the weight of the connections w kj is proportional to the amount of interaction between two nodes. In the case of a weighted connectivity matrix W, we have that $\lambda$ x = W x, and the eigenvector centrality will be, in this case, obtained from eigenvector u 1 of the weighted matrix W [1].},

abstract = {Balanced partitioning is often a crucial first step in solving large-scale graph optimization problems: in some cases, a big graph is chopped into pieces that fit on one machine to be processed independently before stitching the results together, leading to certain suboptimality from the interaction among different pieces. In other cases, links between different parts may show up in the running time and/or network communications cost, hence the desire to have small cut size. We study a distributed balanced partitioning problem where the goal is to partition the vertices of a given graph into k pieces, minimizing the total cut size. Our algorithm is composed of a few steps that are easily implementable in distributed computation frameworks, e.g., MapReduce. The algorithm first embeds nodes of the graph onto a line, and then processes nodes in a distributed manner guided by the linear embedding order. We examine various ways to find the first embedding, e.g., via a hierarchical clustering or Hilbert curves. Then we apply four different techniques such as local swaps, minimum cuts on partition boundaries, as well as contraction and dynamic programming. Our empirical study compares the above techniques with each other, and to previous work in distributed algorithms, e.g., a label propagation method [34], FENNEL [32] and Spinner [23]. We report our results both on a private map graph and several public social networks, and show that our results beat previous distributed algorithms: we notice, e.g., 15-25% reduction in cut size over [34]. We also observe that our algorithms allow for scalable distributed implementation for any number of partitions. Finally, we apply our techniques for the Google Maps Driving Directions to minimize the number of multi-shard queries with the goal of saving in CPU usage. During live experiments, we observe an ≈ 40% drop in the number of multi-shard queries when comparing our method with a standard geography-based method. {\textcopyright} 2016 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

abstract = {A long-standing hypothesis at the interface of physics and neuroscience is that neural networks self-organize to the critical point of a phase transition, thereby optimizing aspects of sensory information processing1–3 . This idea is partially supported by strong evidence for critical dynamics observed in the cerebral cortex4–10 , but the impact of sensory input on these dynamics is largely unknown. Thus, the foundations of this hypothesis—the self-organization process and how it manifests during strong sensory input—remain unstudied experimentally. Here we show in visual cortex and in a computational model that strong sensory input initially elicits cortical network dynamics that are not critical, but adaptive changes in the network rapidly tune the system to criticality. This conclusion is based on observations of multifaceted scaling laws predicted to occur at criticality4,11 . Our findings establish sensory adaptation as a self-organizing mechanism that maintains criticality in visual cortex during sensory information processing.},

Adap-tive sampling is a technique that has recently been shown to achieve a constant factor approximation guarantee for submodular maximization under a cardinality constraint with exponentially fewer adaptive rounds than any previously studied con-stant factor approximation algorithm for this prob-lem. Adaptivity quantifies the number of sequen-tial rounds that an algorithm makes when function evaluations can be executed in parallel and is the parallel running time of an algorithm, up to low order terms. Adaptive sampling achieves its expo-nential speedup at the expense of approximation. In theory, it is guaranteed to produce a solution that is a 1/3 approximation to the optimum. Nev-ertheless, experiments show that adaptive sam-pling techniques achieve far better values in prac-tice. In this paper we provide theoretical justifica-tion for this phenomenon. In particular, we show that under very mild conditions of curvature of a function, adaptive sampling techniques achieve an approximation arbitrarily close to 1/2 while maintaining their low adaptivity. Furthermore, we show that the approximation ratio approaches 1 in direct relationship to a homogeneity property of the submodular function. In addition, we con-duct experiments on real data sets in which the curvature and homogeneity properties can be eas-ily manipulated and demonstrate the relationship between approximation and curvature, as well as the effectiveness of adaptive sampling in practice.},

Most existing work on the learning of diffusion models does not distinguish the events caused by the social influence from those caused by external trends.  In this paper, we extract social events from data streams in social networks, and then use the extracted social events to improve the learning of information diffusion models. We propose a LADP (Latent Action Diffusion Path) model to incorporate the information diffusion model with the model of external trends, and then design an EM-based algorithm to infer the diffusion probabilities, the external trends and the sources of events efficiently.},

In evading detection by commonly employed residue-based bad data detection tests, FDIAs are capable of severely threatening power system security. Since the first published research on FDIAs in 2009, research into FDIA-based cyber-attacks has been extensive. This paper gives a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art in FDIAs against modern power systems. The paper first summarizes the theoretical basis of FDIAs, and then discusses both the physical and economic impacts of a successful FDIA.

A key component in the regulation of genes is transcription factors (TFs), which coordinate the transcriptional control of gene activity. A gene regulatory network (GRN) is a collection of regulatory interactions between TFs and their target genes. The accurate delineation of GRNs offers a significant contribution to our understanding about how plant cells are organized and function, and how individual genes are regulated in various conditions, organs or cell types. During the past decade, important progress has been made in the identification of GRNs using experimental and computational approaches. However, a detailed overview of available platforms supporting the analysis of GRNs in plants is missing. Here, we review current databases, platforms and tools that perform data-driven analyses of gene regulation in Arabidopsis. The platforms are categorized into two sections, 1) promoter motif analysis tools that use motif mapping approaches to find TF motifs in the regulatory sequences of genes of interest and 2) network analysis tools that identify potential regulators for a set of input genes using a range of data types in order to generate GRNs. We discuss the diverse datasets integrated and highlight the strengths and caveats of different platforms. Finally, we shed light on the limitations of the above approaches and discuss future perspectives, including the need for integrative approaches to unravel complex GRNs in plants.},

abstract = {It has long been known that a single-layer fully-connected neural network with an i.i.d. prior over its parameters is equivalent to a Gaussian process (GP), in the limit of infinite network width. This correspondence enables exact Bayesian inference for infinite width neural networks on regression tasks by means of evaluating the corresponding GP. Recently, kernel functions which mimic multi-layer random neural networks have been developed, but only outside of a Bayesian framework. As such, previous work has not identified that these kernels can be used as covariance functions for GPs and allow fully Bayesian prediction with a deep neural network. In this work, we derive the exact equivalence between infinitely wide deep networks and GPs. We further develop a computationally efficient pipeline to compute the covariance function for these GPs. We then use the resulting GPs to perform Bayesian inference for wide deep neural networks on MNIST and CIFAR-10. We observe that trained neural network accuracy approaches that of the corresponding GP with increasing layer width, and that the GP uncertainty is strongly correlated with trained network prediction error. We further find that test performance increases as finite-width trained networks are made wider and more similar to a GP, and thus that GP predictions typically outperform those of finite-width networks. Finally we connect the performance of these GPs to the recent theory of signal propagation in random neural networks.},

An overview of basic concepts of information consensus in networks and methods of convergence and performance analysis for the algorithms are provided. Our analysis framework is based on tools from matrix theory, algebraic graph theory, and control theory. We discuss the connections between consensus problems in networked dynamic systems and diverse applications including synchronization of coupled oscillators, flocking, formation control, fast consensus in small-world networks, Markov processes and gossip-based algorithms, load balancing in networks, rendezvous in space, distributed sensor fusion in sensor networks, and belief propagation. We establish direct connections between spectral and structural properties of complex networks and the speed of information diffusion of consensus algorithms. A brief introduction is provided on networked systems with nonlocal information flow that are considerably faster than distributed systems with lattice-type nearest neighbor interactions. Simulation results are presented that demonstrate the role of small-world effects on the speed of consensus algorithms and cooperative control of multivehicle formations},

abstract = {An important challenge in reinforcement learning, including evolutionary robotics, is to solve multimodal problems, where agents have to act in qualitatively different ways depending on the circumstances. Because multimodal problems are often too difficult to solve directly, it is helpful to take advantage of staging, where a difficult task is divided into simpler subtasks that can serve as stepping stones for solving the overall problem. Unfortunately, choosing an effective ordering for these subtasks is difficult, and a poor ordering can reduce the speed and performance of the learning process. Here, we provide a thorough introduction and investigation of the Combinatorial Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm (CMOEA), which avoids ordering subtasks by allowing all combinations of subtasks to be explored simultaneously. We compare CMOEA against two algorithms that can similarly optimize on multiple subtasks simultaneously: NSGA-II and Lexicase Selection. The algorithms are tested on a multimodal robotics problem with six subtasks as well as a maze navigation problem with a hundred subtasks. On these problems, CMOEA either outperforms or is competitive with the controls. Separately, we show that adding a linear combination over all objectives can improve the ability of NSGA-II to solve these multimodal problems. Lastly, we show that, in contrast to NSGA-II and Lexicase Selection, CMOEA can effectively leverage secondary objectives to achieve state-of-the-art results on the robotics task. In general, our experiments suggest that CMOEA is a promising, state-of-the-art algorithm for solving multimodal problems.},

abstract = {Vulnerability analysis on the power grid has been widely conducted from the substation-only and transmission-line-only perspectives. In order words, it is considered that attacks can occur on substations or transmission lines separately. In this paper, we naturally extend existing two perspectives and introduce the joint-substation-transmission-line's perspective, which means attacks can concurrently occur on substations and transmission lines. Vulnerabilities are referred to as these multiple-component combinations that can yield large damage to the power grid. One such combination consists of substations, transmission lines, or both. The new perspective is promising to discover more power grid vulnerabilities. In particular, we conduct the vulnerability analysis on the IEEE 39 bus system. Compared with known substation-only/transmission-line-only vulnerabilities, joint-substation-transmission-line vulnerabilities account for the largest percentage. Referring to three-component vulnerabilities, for instance, joint-substation-transmission-line vulnerabilities account for 76.06%; substation-only and transmission-line-only vulnerabilities account for 10.96% and 12.98%, respectively. In addition, we adopt two existing metrics, degree and load, to study the joint-substation-transmission-line attack strategy. Generally speaking, the joint-substation-transmission-line attack strategy based on the load metric has better attack performance than comparison schemes.},

abstract = {Low latency analytics on geographically distributed dat- asets (across datacenters, edge clusters) is an upcoming and increasingly important challenge. The dominant approach of aggregating all the data to a single data- center significantly inflates the timeliness of analytics. At the same time, running queries over geo-distributed inputs using the current intra-DC analytics frameworks also leads to high query response times because these frameworks cannot cope with the relatively low and variable capacity of WAN links. We present Iridium, a system for low latency geo-distri- buted analytics. Iridium achieves low query response times by optimizing placement of both data and tasks of the queries. The joint data and task placement op- timization, however, is intractable. Therefore, Iridium uses an online heuristic to redistribute datasets among the sites prior to queries' arrivals, and places the tasks to reduce network bottlenecks during the query's ex- ecution. Finally, it also contains a knob to budget WAN usage. Evaluation across eight worldwide EC2 re- gions using production queries show that Iridium speeds up queries by 3× − 19× and lowers WAN usage by 15%−64% compared to existing baselines.},

abstract = {We start with an overview of a class of submodular functions called SCMMs (sums of concave composed with non-negative modular functions plus a final arbitrary modular). We then define a new class of submodular functions we call {\em deep submodular functions} or DSFs. We show that DSFs are a flexible parametric family of submodular functions that share many of the properties and advantages of deep neural networks (DNNs). DSFs can be motivated by considering a hierarchy of descriptive concepts over ground elements and where one wishes to allow submodular interaction throughout this hierarchy. Results in this paper show that DSFs constitute a strictly larger class of submodular functions than SCMMs. We show that, for any integer $k>0$, there are $k$-layer DSFs that cannot be represented by a $k'$-layer DSF for any $k'<k$. This implies that, like DNNs, there is a utility to depth, but unlike DNNs, the family of DSFs strictly increase with depth. Despite this, we show (using a "backpropagation" like method) that DSFs, even with arbitrarily large $k$, do not comprise all submodular functions. In offering the above results, we also define the notion of an antitone superdifferential of a concave function and show how this relates to submodular functions (in general), DSFs (in particular), negative second-order partial derivatives, continuous submodularity, and concave extensions. To further motivate our analysis, we provide various special case results from matroid theory, comparing DSFs with forms of matroid rank, in particular the laminar matroid. Lastly, we discuss strategies to learn DSFs, and define the classes of deep supermodular functions, deep difference of submodular functions, and deep multivariate submodular functions, and discuss where these can be useful in applications.},

We first define Wheeler graphs and show they have a property we call path coherence. We show that if the state diagram of a finite-state automaton is a Wheeler graph then, by its path coherence, we can order the nodes such that, for any string, the nodes reachable from the initial state or states by processing that string are consecutive. This means that even if the automaton is non-deterministic, we can still store it compactly and process strings with it quickly. We then rederive several variations of the BWT by designing straightforward finite-state automata for the relevant problems and showing that their state diagrams are Wheeler graphs.},

Our first finding, supported by theory and experiments, is that adding depth to a matrix factorization enhances an implicit tendency towards low-rank solutions, oftentimes leading to more accurate recovery. Secondly, we present theoretical and empirical arguments questioning a nascent view by which implicit regularization in matrix factorization can be captured using simple mathematical norms.

Our algorithm is based on a replacement paths algorithm proposed by Hershberger and Suri [2001], and can yield a factor &Theta;( n ) improvement for this problem. But there is a caveat: The fast replacement paths subroutine is known to fail for some directed graphs. However, the failure is easily detected, and so our k shortest paths algorithm optimistically uses the fast subroutine, then switches to a slower but correct algorithm if a failure is detected. Thus, the algorithm achieves its &Theta;( n ) speed advantage only when the optimism is justified. Our empirical results show that the replacement paths failure is a rare phenomenon, and the new algorithm outperforms the current best algorithms; the improvement can be substantial in large graphs. For instance, on GIS map data with about 5,000 nodes and 12,000 edges, our algorithm is 4--8 times faster. In synthetic graphs modeling wireless ad hoc networks, our algorithm is about 20 times faster.},

In many cases we only observe when a node copies information, makes a decision or becomes infected -- but the connectivity, transmission rates between nodes and transmission sources are unknown. Inferring the underlying dynamics is of outstanding interest since it enables forecasting, influencing and retarding infections, broadly construed. To this end, we model diffusion processes as discrete networks of continuous temporal processes occurring at different rates. Given cascade data -- observed infection times of nodes -- we infer the edges of the global diffusion network and estimate the transmission rates of each edge that best explain the observed data. The optimization problem is convex. The model naturally (without heuristics) imposes sparse solutions and requires no parameter tuning. The problem decouples into a collection of independent smaller problems, thus scaling easily to networks on the order of hundreds of thousands of nodes. Experiments on real and synthetic data show that our algorithm both recovers the edges of diffusion networks and accurately estimates their transmission rates from cascade data.},

Recent approaches thus aim at finding a sparser representation of the graph to amplify variations in pairwise distances. Since the effect of sparsification on the layout is difficult to describe analytically, the incorporated filtering parameters of these approaches typically have to be selected manually and individually for each input instance. We here propose the use of graph invariants to determine suitable parameters automatically. This allows us to perform adaptive filtering to obtain drawings in which the cluster structure is most prominent. The approach is based on an empirical relationship between input and output characteristics that is derived from real and synthetic networks. Experimental evaluation shows the effectiveness of our approach and suggests that it can be used by default to increase the robustness of force-directed layout methods.},

abstract = {Many proteins work together with others in groups called complexes in order to achieve a specific function. Discovering protein complexes is important for understanding biological processes and predict protein functions in living organisms. Large-scale and throughput techniques have made possible to compile protein-protein interaction networks (PPI networks), which have been used in several computational approaches for detecting protein complexes. Those predictions might guide future biologic experimental research. Some approaches are topology-based, where highly connected proteins are predicted to be complexes; some propose different clustering algorithms using partitioning, overlaps among clusters for networks modeled with unweighted or weighted graphs; and others use density of clusters and information based on protein functionality. However, some schemes still require much processing time or the quality of their results can be improved. Furthermore, most of the results obtained with computational tools are not accompanied by an analysis of false positives. We propose an effective and efficient mining algorithm for discovering highly connected subgraphs, which is our base for defining protein complexes. Our representation is based on transforming the PPI network into a directed acyclic graph that reduces the number of represented edges and the search space for discovering subgraphs. Our approach considers weighted and unweighted PPI networks. We compare our best alternative using PPI networks from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast) and Homo sapiens (human) with state-of-the-art approaches in terms of clustering, biological metrics and execution times, as well as three gold standards for yeast and two for human. Furthermore, we analyze false positive predicted complexes searching the PDBe (Protein Data Bank in Europe) database in order to identify matching protein complexes that have been purified and structurally characterized. Our analysis shows that more than 50 yeast protein complexes and more than 300 human protein complexes found to be false positives according to our prediction method, i.e., not described in the gold standard complex databases, in fact contain protein complexes that have been characterized structurally and documented in PDBe. We also found that some of these protein complexes have recently been classified as part of a Periodic Table of Protein Complexes.

abstract = {A topic propagating in a social network reaches its tipping point if the number of users discussing it in the network exceeds a critical threshold such that a wide cascade on the topic is likely to occur. In this paper, we consider the task of selecting initial seed users of a topic with minimum size so that {\em with a guaranteed probability} the number of users discussing the topic would reach a given threshold. We formulate the task as an optimization problem called {\em seed minimization with probabilistic coverage guarantee (SM-PCG)}. This problem departs from the previous studies on social influence maximization or seed minimization because it considers influence coverage with {\em probabilistic} guarantees instead of guarantees on {\em expected} influence coverage. We show that the problem is not submodular, and thus is harder than previously studied problems based on submodular function optimization. We provide an approximation algorithm and show that it approximates the optimal solution with both a multiplicative ratio and an additive error. The multiplicative ratio is tight while the additive error would be small if influence coverage distributions of certain seed sets are well concentrated. For one-way bipartite graphs we analytically prove the concentration condition and obtain an approximation algorithm with an $O(\log n)$ multiplicative ratio and an $O(\sqrt{n})$ additive error, where $n$ is the total number of nodes in the social graph. Moreover, we empirically verify the concentration condition in real-world networks and experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm comparing to commonly adopted benchmark algorithms.},

abstract = {IEEE Network measures derived from empirical observations are often poor estimators of the true structure of system as it is impossible to observe all components and all interactions in many real world complex systems. Here, we study attack robustness of complex networks with data missing caused by: 1) a uniform random sampling and 2) a nonuniform random sampling. By introducing the subgraph robustness problem, we develop analytically a framework to investigate robustness properties of the two types of subgraphs under random attacks, localized attacks, and targeted attacks. Interestingly, we find that the benchmark models, such as Erd & #x0151;s-R & #x00E9;nyi graphs, random regular networks, and scale-free networks possess distinct characteristic subgraph robustness features. We show that the network robustness depends on several factors including network topology, attack mode, sampling method and the amount of data missing, generalizing some well-known robustness principles of complex networks. Our results offer insight into the structural effect of missing data in networks and highlight the significance of understanding different sampling processes and their consequences on attack robustness, which may be instrumental in designing robust systems.},

For summarization tasks with the goal of maximizing coverage and diversity, submodular set functions are a natural choice. When the underlying submodular function is unknown, users' feedback can provide noisy evaluations of the function that we seek to maximize. We provide a generic algorithm -- \submM{} -- for maximizing an unknown submodular function under cardinality constraints. This algorithm makes use of a novel exploration module -- \blbox{} -- that proposes good elements based on adaptively sampling noisy function evaluations. \blbox{} is able to accommodate different kinds of observation models such as value queries and pairwise comparisons. We provide PAC-style guarantees on the quality and sampling cost of the solution obtained by \submM{}.

We study contagion blocking in networked populations by identifying edges to remove from a network, thus blocking contagion transmission pathways. We formulate various problems to minimize contagion spread and show that some are efficiently solvable while others are formally hard. We also compare our hardness results to those from node blocking problems and show interesting differences between the two. Our main problem is not only hard, but also has no approximation guarantee, unless P=NP. Therefore, we devise a heuristic for the problem and compare its performance to state-of-the-art heuristics from the literature. We show, through results of 12 (network, heuristic) combinations on three real social networks, that our method offers considerable improvement in the ability to block contagions in weighted and unweighted networks. We also conduct a parametric study to understand the limitations of our approach. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

abstract = {This paper addresses an NP-hard problem, refered to as Network Topology Design with minimum Cost subject to a Reliability constraint (NTD-CR), to design a minimal-cost communication network topology that satisfies a pre-defined reliability constraint. The paper describes a dynamic programming (DP) scheme to solve the NTD-CR problem, and proposes a DP approach, called Dynamic Programming Algorithm to solve NTD-CR (DPCR-ST), to generate the topology using a selected sequence of spanning trees of the network, STXmin The paper shows that our DPCR-ST approach always provides a feasible solution, and produces an optimal topology given an optimal order of spanning trees. The paper proves that the problem of optimally ordering the spanning trees is NP-complete, and proposes three greedy heuristics to generate and order only spanning trees of the network. Each heuristic allows the DPCR-ST approach to generate STXmin using only spanning trees, which improves the time complexity while producing a near optimal topology. Simulations based on fully connected networks that contain up to 2.3 x 10(9) spanning trees show the merits of using the ordering methods and the effectiveness of our algorithm vis-a-vis to four existing state-of-the-art techniques. Our DPCR-ST approach is able to generate 81.5% optimal results, while using only 0.77% of the spanning trees contained in networks. Further, for a typical 2 100 grid network that contains up to 1.899(102) spanning trees, DPCR-ST approach requires only k = 1214 spanning trees to generate a topology with a reliability no larger than 5.05% off from optimal.},

abstract = {Deep artificial neural networks (DNNs) are typically trained via gradient-based learning algorithms, namely backpropagation. Evolution strategies (ES) can rival backprop-based algorithms such as Q-learning and policy gradients on challenging deep reinforcement learning (RL) problems. However, ES can be considered a gradient-based algorithm because it performs stochastic gradient descent via an operation similar to a finite-difference approximation of the gradient. That raises the question of whether non-gradient-based evolutionary algorithms can work at DNN scales. Here we demonstrate they can: we evolve the weights of a DNN with a simple, gradient-free, population-based genetic algorithm (GA) and it performs well on hard deep RL problems, including Atari and humanoid locomotion. The Deep GA successfully evolves networks with over four million free parameters, the largest neural networks ever evolved with a traditional evolutionary algorithm. These results (1) expand our sense of the scale at which GAs can operate, (2) suggest intriguingly that in some cases following the gradient is not the best choice for optimizing performance, and (3) make immediately available the multitude of neuroevolution techniques that improve performance. We demonstrate the latter by showing that combining DNNs with novelty search, which encourages exploration on tasks with deceptive or sparse reward functions, can solve a high-dimensional problem on which reward-maximizing algorithms (e.g.\ DQN, A3C, ES, and the GA) fail. Additionally, the Deep GA is faster than ES, A3C, and DQN (it can train Atari in ${\raise.17ex\hbox{$\scriptstyle\sim$}}$4 hours on one desktop or ${\raise.17ex\hbox{$\scriptstyle\sim$}}$1 hour distributed on 720 cores), and enables a state-of-the-art, up to 10,000-fold compact encoding technique.},

Previous studies are mostly focused on single clustered network and coupled clustered networks with dependency links.

When the networks are fully dependent, we obtain the analytical solution of giant component P ∞ . We show rich phase transition phenomena and analyze their behaviors. We find that, as dependency coupling strength increases, the system changes from second order phase transition through hybrid transition to first order phase transition. For weak dependency coupling strength q A , corresponding to second order phase transition, we find that, clustering has almost no effect on the robustness of network, but for strong dependency coupling strength q A , corresponding to first order transition, the more clustered system is more vulnerable. At the same time, we notice that when the system is more clustered, the hybrid order region is almost unchangeable, the first order region becomes smaller, and the second order region is larger. Additionally, we can see that, the bigger the clustering coefficient c is, the bigger the second order region becomes. For the same c, the density of connectivity links between networks is higher, the second order region becomes smaller, and the density of connectivity links within each network is higher, the second order region becomes bigger.},

For two different attacking strategies we find that the system changes from a secondorder phase transition to a firstorder phase transition as coupling strength q increases. We also notice that the firstorder region becomes smaller and the secondorder region becomes larger as average degree or clustering coefficient increases. And, as the average supported degree approaches infinity, coupled clustered networks become independent and only the secondorder transition is observed, which is similar to q = 0. Furthermore, we find that clustering coefficient has a significant impact on robustness of the system for strong coupling strength, but for weak coupling strength it has little influence, especially for attacking both networks. The study implies that we can obtain a more robust network by reducing clustering coefficient and increasing average degree for strong coupling strength. However, for weak coupling strength, a more robust network is obtained only by increasing average degree for the same support average degree. Additionally, we find that for attacking both networks the system becomes more vulnerable and difficult to defend compared to attacking only one network.},

Therefore, we focus on joint cyber and physical attacks and develop methods to retrieve the grid state information following such an attack.

We use tools from linear algebra and graph theory and leverage the properties of the power flow DC approximation to develop methods for information recovery. Using information observed outside the attacked zone, these methods recover information about the disconnected lines and the phase angles at the buses. We identify sufficient conditions on the zone structure and constraints on the attack characteristics such that these methods can recover the information. We also show that it is NP-hard to find an approximate solution to the problem of partitioning the power grid into the minimum number of attack-resilient zones. However, since power grids can often be represented by planar graphs, we develop a constant approximation partitioning algorithm for these graphs. Finally, we numerically study the relationships between the grid's resilience and its structural properties, and demonstrate the partitioning algorithm on real power grids. The results can provide insights into the design of a secure control network for the smart grid.},

abstract = {The theory of reinforcement learning provides a normative account, deeply rooted in psychological and neuroscientific perspectives on animal behaviour, of how agents may optimize their control of an environment. To use reinforcement learning successfully in situations approaching real-world complexity, however, agents are confronted with a difficult task: they must derive efficient representations of the environment from high-dimensional sensory inputs, and use these to generalize past experience to new situations. Remarkably, humans and other animals seem to solve this problem through a harmonious combination of reinforcement learning and hierarchical sensory processing systems, the former evidenced by a wealth of neural data revealing notable parallels between the phasic signals emitted by dopaminergic neurons and temporal difference reinforcement learning algorithms. While reinforcement learning agents have achieved some successes in a variety of domains, their applicability has previously been limited to domains in which useful features can be handcrafted, or to domains with fully observed, low-dimensional state spaces. Here we use recent advances in training deep neural networks to develop a novel artificial agent, termed a deep Q-network, that can learn successful policies directly from high-dimensional sensory inputs using end-to-end reinforcement learning. We tested this agent on the challenging domain of classic Atari 2600 games. We demonstrate that the deep Q-network agent, receiving only the pixels and the game score as inputs, was able to surpass the performance of all previous algorithms and achieve a level comparable to that of a professional human games tester across a set of 49 games, using the same algorithm, network architecture and hyperparameters. This work bridges the divide between high-dimensional sensory inputs and actions, resulting in the first artificial agent that is capable of learning to excel at a diverse array of challenging tasks.},

While each of these two types of dynamics has individually been studied in the past, much less is known about the connection between the two. How does user information posting and seeking behavior interact with the evolution of the underlying social network structure? Here, we study ways in which network structure reacts to users posting and sharing content. We examine the complete dynamics of the Twitter information network, where users post and reshare information while they also create and destroy connections. We find that the dynamics of network structure can be characterized by steady rates of change, interrupted by sudden bursts. Information diffusion in the form of cascades of post re-sharing often creates such sudden bursts of new connections, which significantly change users' local network structure. These bursts transform users' networks of followers to become structurally more cohesive as well as more homogenous in terms of follower interests. We also explore the effect of the information content on the dynamics of the network and find evidence that the appearance of new topics and real-world events can lead to significant changes in edge creations and deletions. Lastly, we develop a model that quantifies the dynamics of the network and the occurrence of these bursts as a function of the information spreading through the network. The model can successfully predict which information diffusion events will lead to bursts in network dynamics.},

Given a requirement parameter t ??? k, the partial multicut on a tree problem asks to find a minimum cost set of edges whose removal from T disconnects at least t out of these k pairs. This problem generalizes the well-known multicut on a tree problem, in which we are required to disconnect all given pairs. The main contribution of this paper is an (frac(8, 3) + ??{lunate})-approximation algorithm for partial multicut on a tree, whose run time is strongly polynomial for any fixed ??{lunate} > 0. This result is achieved by introducing problem-specific insight to the general framework of using the Lagrangian relaxation technique in approximation algorithms. Our algorithm utilizes a heuristic for the closely related prize-collecting variant, in which we are not required to disconnect all pairs, but rather incur penalties for failing to do so. We provide a Lagrangian multiplier preserving algorithm for the latter problem, with an approximation factor of 2. Finally, we present a new 2-approximation algorithm for multicut on a tree, based on LP-rounding. ?? 2006.},

abstract = {Processing large complex networks like social networks or web graphs has attracted considerable interest. To do this in parallel, we need to partition them into pieces of roughly equal size. Unfortunately, previous parallel graph partitioners originally developed for more regular mesh-like networks do not work well for complex networks. Here we address this problem by parallelizing and adapting the label propagation technique originally developed for graph clustering. By introducing size constraints, label propagation becomes applicable for both the coarsening and the refinement phase of multilevel graph partitioning. This way we exploit the hierarchical cluster structure present in many complex networks. We obtain very high quality by applying a highly parallel evolutionary algorithm to the coarsest graph. The resulting system is both more scalable and achieves higher quality than state-of-The-Art systems like ParMetis or PT-Scotch. For large complex networks the performance differences are very big. As an example, our algorithm partitions a web graph with 3.3 G edges in 16 seconds using 512 cores of a high-performance cluster while producing a high quality partition-none of the competing systems can handle this graph on our system.},

However, the existing works mainly considered a single cascade model across the networks and there is a need for more accurate models and analysis. In this paper, we focus on the interdependent power/communication networks to accurately analyze their vulnerability by considering heterogeneous cascade models. Accurately analyzing interdependent networks is challenging as the cascades are heterogeneous yet interdependent. Also, including multiple timescales into the context can further increase the complexity. To better depict the vulnerability of interdependent networks, we first propose a method to learn a threshold model from historical data to characterize the cascades in the power network and alleviate the need of calculating complicated power network dynamics. Next, we introduce message passing equations to generalize the threshold model in the power network and the percolation model in the communication network, based on which we derive efficient solution for finding the most critical nodes in the interdependent networks. Removing the most critical nodes can cause the largest cascade and thus characterizes the vulnerability. We evaluate the performance of the proposed methods in various datasets and discuss how network parameters, such as the timescales, can impact the vulnerability.},

abstract = {We consider the problem of maximizing the multilinear extension of a submodular function subject a single matroid constraint or multiple packing constraints with a small number of adaptive rounds of evaluation queries. We obtain the first algorithms with low adaptivity for submodular maximization with a matroid constraint. Our algorithms achieve a 1 − 1/e − ϵ approximation for monotone functions and a 1/e − ϵ approximation for non-monotone functions, which nearly matches the best guarantees known in the fully adaptive setting. The number of rounds of adaptivity is O(log2 n/ϵ3), which is an exponential speedup over the existing algorithms. We obtain the first parallel algorithm for non-monotone submodular maximization subject to packing constraints. Our algorithm achieves a 1/e −ϵ approximation using O(log(n/ϵ) log(1/ϵ) log(n+ m)/ϵ2) parallel rounds, which is again an exponential speedup in parallel time over the existing algorithms. For monotone functions, we obtain a 1−1/e−ϵ approximation in O(log(n/ϵ) logm/ϵ2) parallel rounds. The number of parallel rounds of our algorithm matches that of the state of the art algorithm for solving packing LPs with a linear objective (Mahoney et al., 2016).

abstract = {In this paper, we propose the amphibious influence maximization (AIM) model that combines traditional marketing via content providers and viral marketing to consumers in social networks in a single framework. In AIM, a set of content providers and consumers form a bipartite network while consumers also form their social network, and influence propagates from the content providers to consumers and among consumers in the social network following the independent cascade model. An advertiser needs to select a subset of seed content providers and a subset of seed consumers, such that the influence from the seed providers passing through the seed consumers could reach a large number of consumers in the social network in expectation. We prove that the AIM problem is NP-hard to approximate to within any constant factor via a reduction from Feige's k-prover proof system for 3-SAT5. We also give evidence that even when the social network graph is trivial (i.e. has no edges), a polynomial time constant factor approximation for AIM is unlikely. However, when we assume that the weighted bi-adjacency matrix that describes the influence of content providers on consumers is of constant rank, a common assumption often used in recommender systems, we provide a polynomial-time algorithm that achieves approximation ratio of $(1-1/e-\epsilon)^3$ for any (polynomially small) $\epsilon > 0$. Our algorithmic results still hold for a more general model where cascades in social network follow a general monotone and submodular function.},

A number of descriptive network measures have been identified for use within these fields; however, little research examines the relationships of these measures for possible statistical dependence. The research presented in this paper uses Spearman's rank correlation coefficient to examine the statistical dependence between pairs of 24 widely accepted social network measures. Confidence intervals are compared to determine whether computation times between measures in the same correlation group are significantly different. We use a three-factor, four-level, full-factorial experimental design to construct a test set of 64 unique network topologies. The three factors of interest are the network structural properties of size, clusterability, and the scale-free parameter. A set of 320 networks are generated from a power law degree distribution using a random graph generation algorithm. Results indicate that there exists high correlation among 14 of the 24 tested network measures, many of which also exhibit statistically significant differences with respect to computation time. These findings are of interest to analysts seeking to identify measures that provide similar ranked outcomes and where computational efficiency is an important consideration.},

We adopt expected pairwise connectivity (EPC) as a measure to quantify global connectivity and use it to formulate vulnerability assessment as a stochastic optimization problem. The objective is to identify a few number of critical nodes whose removal minimizes EPC in the residual network. While solutions for stochastic optimization problems are often limited to small networks, we present a practical solution that works for larger networks. The key advantages of our solution include 1) the application of a weighted averaging technique that avoids considering all, exponentially many, possible realizations of probabilistic graphs and 2) a Fully Polynomial Time Randomized Approximation Scheme (FPRAS) to efficiently estimate the EPC with any desired accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant improvement on performance of our solution over other heuristic approaches.},

abstract = {Adversarial training, in which a network is trained on adversarial examples, is one of the few defenses against adversarial attacks that withstands strong attacks. Unfortunately, the high cost of generating strong adversarial examples makes standard adversarial training impractical on large-scale problems like ImageNet. We present an algorithm that eliminates the overhead cost of generating adversarial examples by recycling the gradient information computed when updating model parameters. Our "free" adversarial training algorithm achieves state-of-the-art robustness on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets at negligible additional cost compared to natural training, and can be 7 to 30 times faster than other strong adversarial training methods. Using a single workstation with 4 P100 GPUs and 2 days of runtime, we can train a robust model for the large-scale ImageNet classification task that maintains 40% accuracy against PGD attacks.},

The text illustrates the breadth of the modeling and analysis capabilities that are supported by the software and support of complex real-world applications. Pyomo is an open source software package for formulating and solving large-scale optimization and operations research problems. The text begins with a tutorial on simple linear and integer programming models. A detailed reference of Pyomo's modeling components is illustrated with extensive examples, including a discussion of how to load data from data sources like spreadsheets and databases. Chapters describing advanced modeling capabilities for nonlinear and stochastic optimization are also included. The Pyomo software provides familiar modeling features within Python, a powerful dynamic programming language that has a very clear, readable syntax and intuitive object orientation. Pyomo includes Python classes for defining sparse sets, parameters, and variables, which can be used to formulate algebraic expressions that define objectives and constraints. Moreover, Pyomo can be used from a command-line interface and within Python's interactive command environment, which makes it easy to create Pyomo models, apply a variety of optimizers, and examine solutions. The software supports a different modeling approach than commercial AML (Algebraic Modeling Languages) tools, and is designed for flexibility, extensibility, portability, and maintainability but also maintains the central ideas in modern AMLs.},

abstract = {The problem of maximizing non-negative submodular functions has been studied extensively in the last few years. However, most papers consider submodular set functions. Recently, several advances have been made for the more general case of submodular functions on the integer lattice. In this paper, we present a deterministic $\frac{1}{3}$-approximation for maximizing a submodular function on a bounded integer lattice $\{0, \ldots, C\}^n$ using a Double Greedy framework. Moreover, we show that the analysis is tight and that other ideas used for approximating set functions cannot easily be extended. In contrast to set functions, submodularity on the integer lattice does not imply the so-called diminishing returns property. Assuming this property, it was shown that many results for set functions can also be obtained for the integer lattice. In this paper, we consider a further generalization. Instead of the integer lattice, we consider a distributive lattice as the function domain and assume the diminishing returns (DR) property. On the one hand, we show that some approximation algorithms match the set functions setting. In particular, we can obtain a $\frac{1}{2}$-approximation for unconstrained maximization, a $(1-\frac{1}{e})$-approximation for monotone functions under a cardinality constraint and a $\frac{1}{2}$-approximation for a poset matroid constraint. On the other hand, for a knapsack constraint, the problem becomes significantly harder: even for monotone DR-submodular functions, we show that there is no $2^{(\log (n^{1/2} - 1))^\delta - 1}$-approximation for every $\delta > 0$ under the assumption that $3-SAT$ cannot be solved in time $2^{n^{3/4 + \epsilon}}$.},

abstract = {We study the power of fractional allocations of resources to maximize influence in a network. This work extends in a natural way the well-studied model by Kempe, Kleinberg, and Tardos (2003), where a designer selects a (small) seed set of nodes in a social network to influence directly, this influence cascades when other nodes reach certain thresholds of neighbor influence, and the goal is to maximize the final number of influenced nodes. Despite extensive study from both practical and theoretical viewpoints, this model limits the designer to a binary choice for each node, with no way to apply intermediate levels of influence. This model captures some settings precisely, e.g. exposure to an idea or pathogen, but it fails to capture very relevant concerns in others, for example, a manufacturer promoting a new product by distributing five "20% off" coupons instead of giving away one free product. While fractional versions of problems tend to be easier to solve than integral versions, for influence maximization, we show that the two versions have essentially the same computational complexity. On the other hand, the two versions can have vastly different solutions: the added flexibility of fractional allocation can lead to significantly improved influence. Our main theoretical contribution is to show how to adapt the major positive results from the integral case to the fractional case. Specifically, Mossel and Roch (2006) used the submodularity of influence to obtain their integral results; we introduce a new notion of continuous submodularity, and use this to obtain matching fractional results. We conclude that we can achieve the same greedy $(1-1/e-\epsilon)$-approximation for the fractional case as the integral case. In practice, we find that the fractional model performs substantially better than the integral model, according to simulations on real-world social network data.},

Our algorithm takes the amount of available memory as an input parameter, and tries to make the best use of it by splitting the input collection into subcollections sufficiently small that it can compute their BWT in RAM using an optimal linear time algorithm. Next, it merges the partial BWTs in external memory and in the process it also computes the LCP values. We prove that our algorithm performs O(n AveLcp) sequential I/Os, where n is the total length of the collection, and AveLcp is the average Longest Common Prefix of the collection. This bound is an improvement over the known algorithms for the same task. The experimental results show that our algorithm outperforms the current best algorithm for collections of sequences with different lengths and for collections with relatively small average Longest Common Prefix. In the second part of the paper, we show that our algorithm can be modified to output two additional arrays that, used with the BWT and LCP arrays, provide simple, scan based, external memory algorithms for three well known problems in bioinformatics: the computation of maximal repeats, the all pairs suffix-prefix overlaps, and the construction of succinct de Bruijn graphs. To our knowledge, there are no other known external memory algorithms for these problems.},

We model this problem using a graph with n vertices and m edges with K additive QoS parameters associated with each edge, for any constant Kges2. This problem is known to be NP-hard. Fully polynomial time approximation schemes (FPTAS) for the case of K=2 have been reported in the literature. We concentrate on the general case and make the following contributions. 1) We present a very simple (Km+nlogn) time K-approximation algorithm that can be used in hop-by-hop routing protocols. 2) We present an FPTAS for one optimization version of the QoS routing problem with a time complexity of O(m(n/epsi)<sup>K-1</sup>). 3) We present an FPTAS for another optimization version of the QoS routing problem with a time complexity of O(nlogn+m(H/epsi)<sup>K-1</sup>) when there exists an H-hop path satisfying all QoS constraints. When K is reduced to 2, our results compare favorably with existing algorithms. The results of this paper hold for both directed and undirected graphs.

These latent representations encode social relations in a continuous vector space, which is easily exploited by statistical models. DeepWalk generalizes recent advancements in language modeling and unsupervised feature learning (or deep learning) from sequences of words to graphs. DeepWalk uses local information obtained from truncated random walks to learn latent representations by treating walks as the equivalent of sentences. We demonstrate DeepWalk's latent representations on several multi-label network classification tasks for social networks such as BlogCatalog, Flickr, and YouTube. Our results show that DeepWalk outperforms challenging baselines which are allowed a global view of the network, especially in the presence of missing information. DeepWalk's representations can provide F1 scores up to 10% higher than competing methods when labeled data is sparse. In some experiments, DeepWalk's representations are able to outperform all baseline methods while using 60% less training data. DeepWalk is also scalable. It is an online learning algorithm which builds useful incremental results, and is trivially parallelizable. These qualities make it suitable for a broad class of real world applications such as network classification, and anomaly detection. {\textcopyright} 2014 ACM.},

However, it is difficult to accommodate variations in the number of contacts, clustering coefficient and assortativity. Investigations of the relationship between these properties and epidemic behaviour have led to inconsistent conclusions and have not accounted for their interrelationship. In this study, simulation is used to estimate the impact of social network structure on the probability of an SIR (susceptible-infective-removed) epidemic occurring and, if it does, the final size. Increases in assortativity and clustering coefficient are associated with smaller epidemics and the impact is cumulative. Derived values of the basic reproduction ratio (R0) over networks with the highest property values are more than 20% lower than those derived from simulations with zero values of these network properties. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Combinatorial (or discrete) optimization is one of the most active fields in the interface of operations research, computer science, and applied math ematics. Combinatorial optimization problems arise in various applications, including communications network design, VLSI design, machine vision, air line crew scheduling, corporate planning, computer-aided design and man ufacturing, database query design, cellular telephone frequency assignment, constraint directed reasoning, and computational biology. Furthermore, combinatorial optimization problems occur in many diverse areas such as linear and integer programming, graph theory, artificial intelligence, and number theory. All these problems, when formulated mathematically as the minimization or maximization of a certain function defined on some domain, have a commonality of discreteness. Historically, combinatorial optimization starts with linear programming. Linear programming has an entire range of important applications including production planning and distribution, personnel assignment, finance, alloca tion of economic resources, circuit simulation, and control systems. Leonid Kantorovich and Tjalling Koopmans received the Nobel Prize (1975) for their work on the optimal allocation of resources. Two important discover ies, the ellipsoid method (1979) and interior point approaches (1984) both provide polynomial time algorithms for linear programming. These algo rithms have had a profound effect in combinatorial optimization. Many polynomial-time solvable combinatorial optimization problems are special cases of linear programming (e.g. matching and maximum flow). In addi tion, linear programming relaxations are often the basis for many approxi mation algorithms for solving NP-hard problems (e.g. dual heuristics).},

abstract = {This thesis is concerned with the Distributed Information Gathering (DIG) problem in which a Sensor Network is tasked with building a common representation of environment. The problem is motivated by the advantages offered by distributed autonomous sensing systems and the challenges they present. The focus of this study is on Macro Sensor Networks, characterized by platform mobility, heterogeneous teams, and long mission duration. The system under consideration may consist of an arbitrary number of mobile autonomous robots, stationary sensor platforms, and human operators, all linked in a network. This work describes a comprehensive framework called Active Sensor Network (ASN) which addresses the tasks of information fusion, decision making, system configuration, and user interaction. The main design objectives are scalability with the number of robotic platforms, maximum flexibility in implementation and deployment, and robustness to component and communication failure. The framework is described from three complementary points of view: architecture, algorithms, and implementation. The main contribution of this thesis is the development of the ASN architecture. Its design follows three guiding principles: decentralization, modularity, and locality of interactions. These principles are applied to all aspects of the architecture and the framework in general. To achieve flexibility, the design approach emphasizes interactions between components rather than the definition of the components themselves. The architecture specifies a small set of interfaces sufficient to implement a wide range of information gathering systems. In the area of algorithms, this thesis builds on the earlier work on Decentralized Data Fusion (DDF) and its extension to information-theoretic decision making. It presents the Bayesian Decentralized Data Fusion (BDDF) algorithm formulated for environment features represented by a general probability density function. Several specific representations are also considered: Gaussian, discrete, and the Certainty Grid map. Well known algorithms for these representations are shown to implement various aspects of the Bayesian framework. As part of the ASN implementation, a practical indoor sensor network has been developed and tested. Two series of experiments were conducted, utilizing two types of environment representation: 1) point features with Gaussian position uncertainty and 2) Certainty Grid maps. The network was operational for several days at a time, with individual platforms coming on and off-line. On several occasions, the network consisted of 39 software com- ponents. The lessons learned during the systems development may be applicable to other heterogeneous distributed systems with data-intensive algorithms.},

In this paper, with the similar consideration of standard clustering coefficient in binary networks, a definition of the clustering coefficient for bipartite networks based on the fraction of squares is proposed. In order to detect community structures in bipartite networks, two different edge clustering coefficients L C4 and L C3 of bipartite networks are defined, which are based on squares and triples respectively. With the algorithm of cutting the edge with the least clustering coefficient, communities in artificial and real world networks are identified. The results reveal that investigating bipartite networks based on the original structure can show the detailed properties that is helpful to get deep understanding about the networks. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Fast algorithms for submodular maximization problems have a vast potential use in applicative settings, such as machine learning, social networks, and economics. Though fast algorithms were known for some special cases, only recently Badanidiyuru and Vondr\'{a}k (2014) were the first to explicitly look for such algorithms in the general case of maximizing a monotone submodular function subject to a matroid independence constraint. The algorithm of Badanidiyuru and Vondr\'{a}k matches the best possible approximation guarantee, while trying to reduce the number of value oracle queries the algorithm performs. Our main result is a new algorithm for this general case which establishes a surprising tradeoff between two seemingly unrelated quantities: the number of value oracle queries and the number of matroid independence queries performed by the algorithm. Specifically, one can decrease the former by increasing the latter and vice versa, while maintaining the best possible approximation guarantee. Such a tradeoff is very useful since various applications might incur significantly different costs in querying the value and matroid independence oracles. Furthermore, in case the rank of the matroid is $O(n^c)$, where $n$ is the size of the ground set and $c$ is an absolute constant smaller than $1$, the total number of oracle queries our algorithm uses can be made to have a smaller magnitude compared to that needed by Badanidiyuru and Vondr\'{a}k. We also provide even faster algorithms for the well studied special cases of a cardinality constraint and a partition matroid independence constraint, both of which capture many real-world applications and have been widely studied both theorically and in practice.},

Two such applications are learning discrimi-natively structured graphical models and fea-ture selection under computational complex-ity constraints. A commonly used metric for measuring discriminative capacity is the EAR measure which is the difference between two conditional mutual information terms. Feature selection taking complexity consider-ations into account also fall into this frame-work because both the information that a set of features provide and the cost of comput-ing and using the features can be modeled as submodular functions. This problem is NP-hard, and we give a polynomial time heuris-tic for it.

abstract = {Many real-world problems can be reduced to combinatorial optimization on a graph, where the subset or ordering of vertices that maximize some objective function must be found. With such tasks often NP-hard and analytically intractable, reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise as a framework with which efficient heuristic methods to tackle these problems can be learned. Previous works construct the solution subset incrementally, adding one element at a time, however, the irreversible nature of this approach prevents the agent from revising its earlier decisions, which may be necessary given the complexity of the optimization task. We instead propose that the agent should seek to continuously improve the solution by learning to explore at test time. Our approach of exploratory combinatorial optimization (ECO-DQN) is, in principle, applicable to any combinatorial problem that can be defined on a graph. Experimentally, we show our method to produce state-of-the-art RL performance on the Maximum Cut problem. Moreover, because ECO-DQN can start from any arbitrary configuration, it can be combined with other search methods to further improve performance, which we demonstrate using a simple random search.},

Our algorithm can estimate the influence of every node in a network with |\Vcal| nodes and |\Ecal| edges to an accuracy of ϵ using n=O(1/ϵ2) randomizations and up to logarithmic factors O(n|\Ecal|+n|\Vcal|) computations. When used as a subroutine in a greedy influence maximization algorithm, our proposed method is guaranteed to find a set of nodes with an influence of at least (1−1/e)OPT−2ϵ, where OPT is the optimal value. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world data show that the proposed method can easily scale up to networks of millions of nodes while significantly improves over previous state-of-the-arts in terms of the accuracy of the estimated influence and the quality of the selected nodes in maximizing the influence.},

A sequence of $T$ submodular functions over a collection of $n$ elements arrive online, and at each timestep the algorithm must choose a subset of $[n]$ before seeing the function. The algorithm incurs a cost equal to the function evaluated on the chosen set, and seeks to choose a sequence of sets that achieves low expected regret. Our first result is in the full information setting, where the algorithm can observe the entire function after making its decision at each timestep. We give an algorithm in this setting that is $\epsilon$-differentially private and achieves expected regret $\tilde{O}\left(\frac{n^{3/2}\sqrt{T}}{\epsilon}\right)$. This algorithm works by relaxing submodular function to a convex function using the Lovasz extension, and then simulating an algorithm for differentially private online convex optimization. Our second result is in the bandit setting, where the algorithm can only see the cost incurred by its chosen set, and does not have access to the entire function. This setting is significantly more challenging because the algorithm does not receive enough information to compute the Lovasz extension or its subgradients. Instead, we construct an unbiased estimate using a single-point estimation, and then simulate private online convex optimization using this estimate. Our algorithm using bandit feedback is $\epsilon$-differentially private and achieves expected regret $\tilde{O}\left(\frac{n^{3/2}T^{3/4}}{\epsilon}\right)$.},

Very recent improvements for this problem by Balkanski, Rubinstein, and Singer [6] and Ene and Nguyen [21] resulted in a near-optimal $(1-1/e-\epsilon)$-approximation in $O(\log n/\epsilon^2)$ rounds of adaptivity. Partly motivated by the goal of extending these results to more general constraints, we describe parallel algorithms for approximately maximizing the multilinear relaxation of a monotone submodular function subject to packing constraints. Formally our problem is to maximize $F(x)$ over $x \in [0,1]^{n}$ subject to $Ax \le 1$ where $F$ is the multilinear relaxation of a monotone submodular function. Our algorithm achieves a near-optimal $(1-1/e-\epsilon)$-approximation in $O(\log^2 m \log n/\epsilon^4)$ rounds where $n$ is the cardinality of the ground set and $m$ is the number of packing constraints. For many constraints of interest, the resulting fractional solution can be rounded via known randomized rounding schemes that are oblivious to the specific submodular function. We thus derive randomized algorithms with poly-logarithmic adaptivity for a number of constraints including partition and laminar matroids, matchings, knapsack constraints, and their intersections.},

Furthermore, to approximate solutions to constrained combinatorial optimization problems such as the TSP with time windows, we train hierarchical GPNs (HGPNs) using RL, which learns a hierarchical policy to find an optimal city permutation under constraints. Each layer of the hierarchy is designed with a separate reward function, resulting in stable training. Our results demonstrate that GPNs trained on small-scale TSP50/100 problems generalize well to larger-scale TSP500/1000 problems, with shorter tour lengths and faster computational times. We verify that for constrained TSP problems such as the TSP with time windows, the feasible solutions found via hierarchical RL training outperform previous baselines. In the spirit of reproducible research we make our data, models, and code publicly available.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 IEEE. Information propagation in online social networks (OSNs), which helps shaping consumers' purchasing decisions, has received a lot of attention. The ultimate goal of marketing and advertising in OSNs is to massively influence audiences and enlarge the number of product adoptions. Most of existing works focus on maximizing the influence of a single product or promoting the adoption of one product in competing campaigns. However, in reality, the majority of companies produce various products for supplying customers with different needs. Therefore, it is truly significant and also challenging to wisely distribute limited budget across multiple products in viral marketing. In this paper, we investigate a Profit Maximization with Multiple Adoptions (PM2A) problem, which aims at maximizing the overall profit across all products. The natural greedy fails to provide a bounded result. In order to select high quality seeds for information propagation, we first proposed the PMCE algorithm, which has a ratio 1/2 (1 - 1/e2). Moreover, we further improve this ratio to (1-1/e) by proposing the PMIS algorithm. Comprehensive experiments on three real social networks are conducted. And results show that our algorithms outperform other heuristics, and better distribute the budget in terms of profit maximization.},

abstract = {Modern machine learning focuses on highly expressive models that are able to fit or interpolate the data completely, resulting in zero training loss. For such models, we show that the stochastic gradients of common loss functions satisfy a strong growth condition. Under this condition, we prove that constant step-size stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with Nesterov acceleration matches the convergence rate of the deterministic accelerated method for both convex and strongly-convex functions. We also show that this condition implies that SGD can find a first-order stationary point as efficiently as full gradient descent in non-convex settings. Under interpolation, we further show that all smooth loss functions with a finite-sum structure satisfy a weaker growth condition. Given this weaker condition, we prove that SGD with a constant step-size attains the deterministic convergence rate in both the strongly-convex and convex settings. Under additional assumptions, the above results enable us to prove an O(1/k^2) mistake bound for k iterations of a stochastic perceptron algorithm using the squared-hinge loss. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings with experiments on synthetic and real datasets.},

Online users are constantly creating new links when exposed to new information sources, and in turn these links are alternating the way information spreads. However, these two highly intertwined stochastic processes, information diffusion and network evolution, have been predominantly studied separately, ignoring their co-evolutionary dynamics. We propose a temporal point process model, COEVOLVE, for such joint dynamics, allowing the intensity of one process to be modulated by that of the other. This model allows us to efficiently simulate interleaved diffusion and network events, and generate traces obeying common diffusion and network patterns observed in real-world networks. Furthermore, we also develop a convex optimization framework to learn the parameters of the model from historical diffusion and network evolution traces. We experimented with both synthetic data and data gathered from Twitter, and show that our model provides a good fit to the data as well as more accurate predictions than alternatives.},

Such problems are important in both theory and practice because their objective functions are very general. Obtaining further improvements for many submodular maximization problems boils down to finding better algorithms for optimizing a relaxation of them known as the multilinear extension. In this work we present an algorithm for optimizing the multilinear relaxation whose guarantee improves over the guarantee of the best previous algorithm (which was given by Ene and Nguyen (2016)). Moreover, our algorithm is based on a new technique which is, arguably, simpler and more natural for the problem at hand. In a nutshell, previous algorithms for this problem rely on symmetry properties which are natural only in the absence of a constraint. Our technique avoids the need to resort to such properties, and thus, seems to be a better fit for constrained problems.},

Previous work shows that such a combination enormously increases the difficulty of studies, even when the cost function is linear. In this paper, assuming that the maximum covering requirement $r_{\max}=\max_e r_e$ is a constant and the cost function is nonnegative, monotone nondecreasing, and submodular, we give the first randomized bicriteria algorithm for SCPMC the output of which fully covers at least $(q-\varepsilon)$-percentage of all elements and the performance ratio is $O(b/\varepsilon)$ with a high probability, where $b=\max_e\binom{f}{r_{e}}$ and $f$ is the maximum number of sets containing a common element. The algorithm is based on a novel non-linear program. Furthermore, in the case when the covering requirement $r\equiv 1$, a bicriteria $O(f/\varepsilon)$-approximation can be achieved even when monotonicity requirement is dropped off from the cost function.},

abstract = {With a rapid expansion of online social networks (OSNs), millions of users are tweeting and sharing their personal status daily without being aware of where that information eventually travels to. Likewise, with a huge magnitude of data available on OSNs, it poses a substantial challenge to track how a piece of information leaks to specific targets. In this paper, we study the problem of smartly sharing information to control the propagation of sensitive information in OSNs. In particular, we formulate and investigate the Maximum Circle of Trust problem of which we seek to construct a circle of trust on the fly so that OSN users can safely share their information knowing that it will not be propagated to their unwanted targets (whom they are not willing to share with). Since most of messages in OSNs are propagated within 2 to 5 hops, we first investigate this problem under 2-hop information propagation by showing the hardness of obtaining an optimal solution, along with an algorithm with proven performance guarantee. In a general case where information can be propagated more than two hops, the problem is #P-hard i.e. the problem cannot be solved in a polynomial time. Thus we propose a novel greedy algorithm, hybridizing the handy but costly sampling method with a novel cut-based estimation. The quality of the hybrid algorithm is comparable to that of the sampling method while taking only a tiny fraction of the time. We have validated the effectiveness of our solutions in many real-world traces. Such an extensive experiment also highlights several important observations on information leakage which help to sharpen the security of OSNs in the future.},

In this exploratory research paper, we start from this premise and posit that all existing index structures can be replaced with other types of models, including deep-learning models, which we term learned indexes. The key idea is that a model can learn the sort order or structure of lookup keys and use this signal to effectively predict the position or existence of records. We theoretically analyze under which conditions learned indexes outperform traditional index structures and describe the main challenges in designing learned index structures. Our initial results show, that by using neural nets we are able to outperform cache-optimized B-Trees by up to 70% in speed while saving an order-of-magnitude in memory over several real-world data sets. More importantly though, we believe that the idea of replacing core components of a data management system through learned models has far reaching implications for future systems designs and that this work just provides a glimpse of what might be possible.},

Instead, we introduce a flexible and tractable random graph process that extends the family of Markovian random graphs (MRG). One of the main limitations of MRG's is that it can only replicate switching patterns with exponential inter-switching times. To overcome this limitation, we propose the family of aggregated-Markovian random graph processes, which is able to replicate, with arbitrary accuracy, any distribution of inter-switching times. We study the stability spreading processes in this extended family. We first show that a direct analysis based on the It\^o formula provide conditions in terms of the eigenvalues of a matrix whose size grows exponentially with the number of edges. Using alternative tools, we derive stability conditions involving the eigenvalues of a matrix whose size grows linearly with the number of nodes. Based on our results, we show that the aggregated static network approximates the epidemic threshold more accurately as the number of nodes grows, or the temporal volatility of the random graph process is reduced. Apart from these theoretical results, we illustrate our findings via numerical simulations.},

However, accurate and systematic evaluation of these methods is hampered by the difficulty of constructing adequate benchmarks and the lack of tools for a differentiated analysis of network predictions on such benchmarks.Results: Here, we describe a novel and comprehensive method for in silico benchmark generation and performance profiling of network inference methods available to the community as an open-source software called GeneNetWeaver (GNW). In addition to the generation of detailed dynamical models of gene regulatory networks to be used as benchmarks, GNW provides a network motif analysis that reveals systematic prediction errors, thereby indicating potential ways of improving inference methods. The accuracy of network inference methods is evaluated using standard metrics such as precision-recall and receiver operating characteristic curves. We show how GNW can be used to assess the performance and identify the strengths and weaknesses of six inference methods. Furthermore, we used GNW to provide the international Dialogue for Reverse Engineering Assessments and Methods (DREAM) competition with three network inference challenges (DREAM3, DREAM4 and DREAM5). {\textcopyright} The Author 2011.

abstract = {The dramatic growth in practical applications for machine learning over the last ten years has been accompanied by many important developments in the underlying algorithms and techniques. For example, Bayesian methods have grown from a specialist niche to become mainstream, while graphical models have emerged as a general framework for describing and applying probabilistic techniques. The practical applicability of Bayesian methods has been greatly enhanced by the development of a range of approximate inference algorithms such as variational Bayes and expectation propagation, while new models based on kernels have had a significant impact on both algorithms and applications. This completely new textbook reflects these recent developments while providing a comprehensive introduction to the fields of pattern recognition and machine learning. It is aimed at advanced undergraduates or first-year PhD students, as well as researchers and practitioners. No previous knowledge of pattern recognition or machine learning concepts is assumed. Familiarity with multivariate calculus and basic linear algebra is required, and some experience in the use of probabilities would be helpful though not essential as the book includes a self-contained introduction to basic probability theory. The book is suitable for courses on machine learning, statistics, computer science, signal processing, computer vision, data mining, and bioinformatics. Extensive support is provided for course instructors, including more than 400 exercises, graded according to difficulty. Example solutions for a subset of the exercises are available from the book web site, while solutions for the remainder can be obtained by instructors from the publisher. The book is supported by a great deal of additional material, and the reader is encouraged to visit the book web site for the latest information. A forthcoming companion volume will deal with practical aspects of pattern recognition and machine learning, and will include free software implementations of the key algorithms along with example data sets and demonstration programs. Christopher Bishop is Assistant Director at Microsoft Research Cambridge, and also holds a Chair in Computer Science at the University of Edinburgh. He is a Fellow of Darwin College Cambridge, and was recently elected Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering.

abstract = {Counting the number of triangles in a graph is a beautiful algorithmic problem which has gained importance over the last years due to its significant role in complex network analysis. Metrics frequently computed such as the clustering coefficient and the transitivity ratio involve the execution of a triangle counting algorithm. Furthermore, several interesting graph mining applications rely on computing the number of triangles in the graph of interest. In this paper, we focus on the problem of counting triangles in a graph. We propose a practical method, out of which all triangle counting algorithms can potentially benefit. Using a straightforward triangle counting algorithm as a black box, we performed 166 experiments on real-world networks and on synthetic datasets as well, where we show that our method works with high accuracy, typically more than 99% and gives significant speedups, resulting in even 130 times faster performance.},

abstract = {Video summarization is a challenging problem with great application potential. Whereas prior approaches, largely unsupervised in nature, focus on sampling useful frames and assembling them as summaries, we consider video summarization as a supervised subset selection problem. Our idea is to teach the system to learn from human-created summaries how to select informative and diverse subsets, so as to best meet evaluation metrics derived from human-perceived quality. To this end, we propose the sequential determinantal point process (seqDPP), a probabilistic model for diverse sequential subset selection. Our novel seqDPP heeds the inherent sequential structures in video data, thus overcoming the deficiency of the standard DPP, which treats video frames as randomly permutable items. Meanwhile, seqDPP retains the power of modeling diverse subsets, essential for summarization. Our extensive results of summarizing videos from 3 datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our method, compared to not only existing unsuper-vised methods but also naive applications of the standard DPP model.},

Nevertheless, wind turbines are still blind machines because the control center is responsible for managing and controlling individual wind turbines that are turned on or off according to demand for electricity. In this paper, we propose a communication network architecture for smart-wind power farms (Smart-WPFs). The proposed architecture is designed for wind turbines to communicate directly and share sensing data in order to maximize power generation, WPF availability, and turbine efficiency. We also designed a sensor data frame structure to carry sensing data from different wind turbine parts such as the rotor, transformer, nacelle, etc. The data frame includes a logical node ID (LNID), sensor node ID (SNID), sensor type (ST), and sensor data based on the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) 61400-25 standard. We present an analytical model that describes upstream traffic between the wind turbines and the control center. Using a queueing theory approach, the upstream traffic is evaluated in view of bandwidth utilization and average queuing delay. The performance of the proposed network architectures are evaluated by using analytical and simulation models.},

Next, based on the insights obtained from the analyses of the datasets, we design a mathematical model that describes the evolution of a retweet graph by three main parameters. We then quantify, analytically and by simulation, the influence of the model parameters on the basic characteristics of the retweet graph, such as the density of edges and the size and density of the LCC. Finally, we put the model in practice, estimate its parameters and compare the resulting behavior of the model to our datasets.},

abstract = {There is great interest in *saliency methods* (also called *attribution methods*), which give "explanations" for a deep net's decision, by assigning a *score* to each feature/pixel in the input. Their design usually involves credit-assignment via the gradient of the output with respect to input. Recently Adebayo et al. [arXiv:1810.03292] questioned the validity of many of these methods since they do not pass simple *sanity checks* which test whether the scores shift/vanish when layers of the trained net are randomized, or when the net is retrained using random labels for inputs. We propose a simple fix to existing saliency methods that helps them pass sanity checks, which we call *competition for pixels*. This involves computing saliency maps for all possible labels in the classification task, and using a simple competition among them to identify and remove less relevant pixels from the map. The simplest variant of this is *Competitive Gradient $\odot$ Input (CGI)*: it is efficient, requires no additional training, and uses only the input and gradient. Some theoretical justification is provided for it (especially for ReLU networks) and its performance is empirically demonstrated.},

abstract = {We propose an external memory algorithm for the computation of the BWT and LCP array for a collection of sequences. Our algorithm takes the amount of available memory as an input parameter, and tries to make the best use of it by splitting the input collection into subcollections sufficiently small that it can compute their BWT in RAM using an optimal linear time algorithm. Next, it merges the partial BWTs in external memory and in the process it also computes the LCP values. We prove that our algorithm performs O(n AveLcp) sequential I/Os, where n is the total length of the collection, and AveLcp is the average Longest Common Prefix of the collection. This bound is an improvement over the known algorithms for the same task. The experimental results show that our algorithm outperforms the current best algorithm for collections of sequences with different lengths and for collections with relatively small average Longest Common Prefix. In the second part of the paper, we show that our algorithm can be modified to output two additional arrays that, used with the BWT and LCP arrays, provide simple, scan based, external memory algorithms for three well known problems in bioinformatics: the computation of maximal repeats, the all pairs suffix-prefix overlaps, and the construction of succinct de Bruijn graphs. To our knowledge, there are no other known external memory algorithms for these problems.},

Recent advances in stochastic actor-based modeling, combined with self-reported data on a popular online social network site, allow us to address this question with a greater degree of precision than has heretofore been possible. Using data on the Facebook activity of a cohort of college students over 4 years, we find that students who share certain tastes in music and in movies, but not in books, are significantly likely to befriend one another. Meanwhile, we find little evidence for the diffusion of tastes among Facebook friends-except for tastes in classical/jazz music. These findings shed light on the mechanisms responsible for observed network homogeneity; provide a statistically rigorous assessment of the coevolution of cultural tastes and social relationships; and suggest important qualifications to our understanding of both homophily and contagion as generic social processes.},

This task can be challenging as it requires joint modeling of context-specific activation of cis-regulatory elements (REs) and the effects on transcription of associated regulatory factors. To meet this challenge, we propose a statistical approach based on paired expression and chromatin accessibility (PECA) data across diverse cellular contexts. In our approach, we model (i) the localization to REs of chromatin regulators (CRs) based on their interaction with sequence-specific TFs, (ii) the activation of REs due to CRs that are localized to them, and (iii) the effect of TFs bound to activated REs on the transcription of target genes (TGs). The transcriptional regulatory network inferred by PECA provides a detailed view of how trans- and cis-regulatory elements work together to affect gene expression in a context-specific manner. We illustrate the feasibility of this approach by analyzing paired expression and accessibility data from the mouse Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) and explore various applications of the resulting model.},

In this paper, we study influence maximization in the linear threshold model, one of the important models formalizing the behavior of influence propagation in social networks. We first show that computing exact influence in general networks in the linear threshold model is #P-hard, which closes an open problem left in the seminal work on influence maximization by Kempe, Kleinberg, and Tardos, 2003. As a contrast, we show that computing influence in directed a cyclic graphs (DAGs) can be done in time linear to the size of the graphs. Based on the fast computation in DAGs, we propose the first scalable influence maximization algorithm tailored for the linear threshold model. We conduct extensive simulations to show that our algorithm is scalable to networks with millions of nodes and edges, is orders of magnitude faster than the greedy approximation algorithm proposed by Kempe et al. and its optimized versions, and performs consistently among the best algorithms while other heuristic algorithms not design specifically for the linear threshold model have unstable performances on different real-world networks.},

abstract = {Cyber-epidemics, the widespread of fake news or propaganda through social media, can cause devastating economic and political consequences. A common countermeasure against cyber-epidemics is to disable a small subset of suspected social connections or accounts to effectively contain the epidemics. An example is the recent shutdown of 125,000 ISIS-related Twitter accounts. Despite many proposed methods to identify such subset, none are scalable enough to provide high-quality solutions in nowadays billion-size networks. To this end, we investigate the Spread Interdiction problems that seek most effective links (or nodes) for removal under the well-known Linear Threshold model. We propose novel CPU-GPU methods that scale to networks with billions of edges, yet, possess rigorous theoretical guarantee on the solution quality. At the core of our methods is an $O(1)$-space out-of-core algorithm to generate a new type of random walks, called Hitting Self-avoiding Walks (HSAWs). Such a low memory requirement enables handling of big networks and, more importantly, hiding latency via scheduling of millions of threads on GPUs. Comprehensive experiments on real-world networks show that our algorithms provides much higher quality solutions and are several order of magnitude faster than the state-of-the art. Comparing to the (single-core) CPU counterpart, our GPU implementations achieve significant speedup factors up to 177x on a single GPU and 338x on a GPU pair.},

This is a natural generalization of the classical problems that also captures resource limitations in practical scenarios. We obtain the following results. For the unweighted vertex cover problem with hard capacities we give a 3-approximation algorithm which is based on randomized rounding with alterations. We prove that the weighted version is at least as hard as the set cover problem. This is an interesting separation between the approximability of weighted and unweighted versions of a "natural" graph problem. A logarithmic approximation factor for both the set cover and the weighted vertex cover problem with hard capacities follows from the work of Wolsey (1982) on submodular set cover. We provide in this paper a simple and intuitive proof for this bound.},

Here we study random K -satisfiability for K = 3, 4 by the Backtracking Survey Propagation (BSP) algorithm, which is able to find, in a time almost linear in the problem size, solutions within a region never reached before: for K = 3 the algorithmic threshold practically coincides with the SAT-UNSAT threshold, while for K=4 it extrapolates beyond the rigidity threshold, where most of the solutions acquire a positive density of frozen variables. All solutions found by BSP have no frozen variables, thus supporting the conjecture that only unfrozen solutions can be found in linear time. The iterative algorithm for determining which variables are frozen in a solution (whitening) reaches the all-variables-unfrozen fixed point following a two step process and has a relaxation time diverging at the algorithmic threshold.},

abstract = {Antimicrobial resistance has become an imminent concern for public health. As methods for detection and characterization of antimicrobial resistance move from targeted culture and polymerase chain reaction to high throughput metagenomics, appropriate resources for the analysis of large-scale data are required. Currently, antimicrobial resistance databases are tailored to smaller-scale, functional profiling of genes using highly descriptive annotations. Such characteristics do not facilitate the analysis of large-scale, ecological sequence datasets such as those produced with the use of metagenomics for surveillance. In order to overcome these limitations, we present MEGARes (https://megares.meglab.org), a hand-curated antimicrobial resistance database and annotation structure that provides a foundation for the development of high throughput acyclical classifiers and hierarchical statistical analysis of big data. MEGARes can be browsed as a stand-alone resource through the website or can be easily integrated into sequence analysis pipelines through download.

Undesirable results caused by misinformation propagation make its timely detection very imperative. An important question is how many monitors are required to detect all misinformation cascades at their early stage. To answer this question, we define a Time Constrained Misinformation Detection (TCMD) problem. As we have proved, there is no polynomial time (1 - ϵ) ln n-approximation for the TCMD problem. The large number of independent misinformation cascades and heterogeneous delays make misinformation detection more challenging. Our approach includes stochastic programming and an O(ln(1 + n)) approximation algorithm for one-hop detection. This approach can provide a lower bound on the number of required monitors for general detection. Furthermore, we propose a network-compression based solution, whose effectiveness is validated by extensive experimental results.},

abstract = {We consider the classical problem of maximizing a monotone submodular function subject to a cardinality constraint, which, due to its numerous applications, has recently been studied in various computational models. We consider a clean multi-player model that lies between the offline and streaming model, and study it under the aspect of one-way communication complexity. Our model captures the streaming setting (by considering a large number of players), and, in addition, two player approximation results for it translate into the robust setting. We present tight one-way communication complexity results for our model, which, due to the above-mentioned connections, have multiple implications in the data stream and robust setting. Even for just two players, a prior information-theoretic hardness result implies that no approximation factor above $1/2$ can be achieved in our model, if only queries to feasible sets are allowed. We show that the possibility of querying infeasible sets can actually be exploited to beat this bound, by presenting a tight $2/3$-approximation taking exponential time, and an efficient $0.514$-approximation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example where querying a submodular function on infeasible sets leads to provably better results. Through the above-mentioned link to the robust setting, both of these algorithms improve on the current state-of-the-art for robust submodular maximization, showing that approximation factors beyond $1/2$ are possible. Moreover, exploiting the link of our model to streaming, we settle the approximability for streaming algorithms by presenting a tight $1/2+\varepsilon$ hardness result, based on the construction of a new family of coverage functions. This improves on a prior $1-1/e+\varepsilon$ hardness and matches, up to an arbitrarily small margin, the best known approximation algorithm.},

The effects of the added neurons are proven to automatically vanish at every local minimum.

We show the NP-hardness of the problem, but propose two greedy algorithms to minimize the reciprocal of C(S). We prove the approximation ratios by showing the monotonicity and supermodularity. A proposed deterministic greedy algorithm has an approximation factor (1 − k k−1 {\textperiodcentered} 1 e) and cubic running time. To compare with, a proposed randomized algorithm gives (1 − k k −1 {\textperiodcentered} 1 e − ϵ)-approximation in nearly-linear time, for any ϵ > 0.

Our proposed method achieves this by compressing the input graph prior to embedding it, effectively avoiding troublesome embedding configurations (i.e. local minima) which can pose problems to non-convex optimization. HARP works by finding a smaller graph which approximates the global structure of its input. This simplified graph is used to learn a set of initial representations, which serve as good initializations for learning representations in the original, detailed graph. We inductively extend this idea, by decomposing a graph in a series of levels, and then embed the hierarchy of graphs from the coarsest one to the original graph. HARP is a general meta-strategy to improve all of the state-of-the-art neural algorithms for embedding graphs, including DeepWalk, LINE, and Node2vec. Indeed, we demonstrate that applying HARP's hierarchical paradigm yields improved implementations for all three of these methods, as evaluated on both classification tasks on real-world graphs such as DBLP, BlogCatalog, CiteSeer, and Arxiv, where we achieve a performance gain over the original implementations by up to 14% Macro F1.},

abstract = {The red-blue pebble game was formulated in the 1980s [14] to model the I/O complexity of algorithms on a two-level memory hierarchy. Given a directed acyclic graph representing computations (vertices) and their dependencies (edges), the red-blue pebble game allows sequentially adding, removing, and recoloring red or blue pebbles according to a few rules, where red pebbles represent data in cache (fast memory) and blue pebbles represent data on disk (slow, external memory). Specifically, a vertex can be newly pebbled red if and only if all of its predecessors currently have a red pebble; pebbles can always be removed; and pebbles can be recolored between red and blue (corresponding to reading or writing data between disk and cache, also called I/Os or memory transfers). Given an upper bound on the number of red pebbles at any time (the cache size), the goal is to compute a game execution with the fewest pebble recolorings (memory transfers) that finish with pebbles on a specified subset of nodes (outputs get computed). In this paper, we investigate the complexity of computing this trade-off between red-pebble limit (cache size) and number of recolorings (memory transfers) in general DAGs. First we prove this problem PSPACE-complete through an extension of the proof PSPACE-hardness of black pebbling complexity [13]. Second, we consider a natural restriction on the red-blue pebble game to forbid pebble deletions, or equivalently, forbid discarding data from cache without first writing it to disk. This assumption both simplifies the model and immediately places the trade-off computation problem within NP. Unfortunately, we show that even this restricted version is NP-complete. Finally, we show that the trade-off problem parameterized by the number of transitions is W[1]-hard, meaning that there is likely no algorithm running in a fixed polynomial for constant number of transitions.},

We focus on stochastic functions that are given as an expectation of functions over a distribution $P$. In practice, we often have only a limited set of samples $f_i$ from $P$. The standard approach indirectly optimizes $f$ by maximizing the sum of $f_i$. However, this ignores generalization to the true (unknown) distribution. In this paper, we achieve better performance on the actual underlying function $f$ by directly optimizing a combination of bias and variance. Algorithmically, we accomplish this by showing how to carry out distributionally robust optimization (DRO) for submodular functions, providing efficient algorithms backed by theoretical guarantees which leverage several novel contributions to the general theory of DRO. We also show compelling empirical evidence that DRO improves generalization to the unknown stochastic submodular function.},

Given this distributed setting, we develop Constraint-Distributed Continuous Greedy (CDCG), a message passing algorithm that converges to the tight $(1-1/e)$ approximation factor of the optimum global solution using only local computation and communication. It is known that a sequential greedy algorithm can only achieve a $1/2$ multiplicative approximation of the optimal solution for this class of problems in the distributed setting. Our framework relies on lifting the discrete problem to a continuous domain and developing a consensus algorithm that achieves the tight $(1-1/e)$ approximation guarantee of the global discrete solution once a proper rounding scheme is applied.

OverSketched Newton leverages matrix sketching ideas from Randomized Numerical Linear Algebra to compute the Hessian approximately. These sketching methods lead to inbuilt resiliency against stragglers that are a characteristic of serverless architectures. We establish that OverSketched Newton has a linear-quadratic convergence rate, and we empirically validate our results by solving large-scale supervised learning problems on real-world datasets.

abstract = {Hybrid indexing is a recent approach to text indexing that allows the space-usage of conventional text indexes (e.g., suffix trees, suffix arrays, FM-indexes) to scale well with the text size, n, when z, the size of the Lempel-Ziv parsing of the text, is small relative to n. The price for this improved scalability is that an upper bound M on the pattern length that can be searched for must be declared at index construction time. Because the size of the resulting index contains an O(M z) term, M must be kept reasonably small, though it has been shown that M ≈ 100 leads to acceptable performance in some genomic applications. However, despite its promise, the practical performance of hybrid indexing relative to other compressed index data structures is poorly understood. This paper addresses that need, detailing experiments that show hybrid indexing — when carefully implemented — to be significantly smaller and faster than alternative approaches on a broad range of data of different levels of compressibility. We also describe practical extensions to hybrid indexing that obviate the restriction on M , supporting search for patterns of arbitrary length.},

abstract = {A vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) is a subclass of mobile ad hoc networks, considered as one of the most important approach of intelligent transportation systems (ITS). It allows inter-vehicle communication in which their movement is restricted by a VANET mobility model and supported by some roadside base stations as fixed infrastructures. Multicasting provides different traffic information to a limited number of vehicle drivers by a parallel transmission. However, it represents a very important challenge in the application of vehicular ad hoc networks especially, in the case of the network scalability. In the applications of this sensitive field, it is very essential to transmit correct data anywhere and at any time. Consequently, the VANET routing protocols should be adapted appropriately and meet effectively the quality of service (QoS) requirements in an optimized multicast routing. In this paper, we propose a novel bee colony optimization algorithm called bees life algorithm (BLA) applied to solve the quality of service multicast routing problem (QoS-MRP) for vehicular ad hoc networks as NP-Complete problem with multiple constraints. It is considered as swarm-based algorithm which imitates closely the life of the colony. It follows the two important behaviors in the nature of bees which are the reproduction and the food foraging. BLA is applied to solve QoS-MRP with four objectives which are cost, delay, jitter, and bandwidth. It is also submitted to three constraints which are maximum allowed delay, maximum allowed jitter and minimum requested bandwidth. In order to evaluate the performance and the effectiveness of this realized proposal using C++ and integrated at the routing protocol level, a simulation study has been performed using the network simulator (NS2) based on a mobility model of VANET. The comparisons of the experimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperformed in an efficient way genetic algorithm (GA), bees algorithm (BA) and marriage in honey bees optimization (MBO) algorithm as state-of-the-art conventional metaheuristics applied to QoS-MRP problem with the same simulation parameters. ?? 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

GNNs follow a neighborhood aggregation scheme, where the representation vector of a node is computed by recursively aggregating and transforming representation vectors of its neighboring nodes. Many GNN variants have been proposed and have achieved state-of-the-art results on both node and graph classification tasks. However, despite GNNs revolutionizing graph representation learning, there is limited understanding of their representational properties and limitations. Here, we present a theoretical framework for analyzing the expressive power of GNNs to capture different graph structures. Our results characterize the discriminative power of popular GNN variants, such as Graph Convolutional Networks and GraphSAGE, and show that they cannot learn to distinguish certain simple graph structures. We then develop a simple architecture that is provably the most expressive among the class of GNNs and is as powerful as the Weisfeiler-Lehman graph isomorphism test. We empirically validate our theoretical findings on a number of graph classification benchmarks, and demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance.},

abstract = {Network representations are useful for describing the structure of a large variety of complex systems. Although most studies of real-world networks suppose that nodes are connected by only a single type of edge, most natural and engineered systems include multiple subsystems and layers of connectivity. This new paradigm has attracted a great deal of attention and one fundamental challenge is to characterize multilayer networks both structurally and dynamically. One way to address this question is to study the spectral properties of such networks. Here, we apply the framework of graph quotients, which occurs naturally in this context, and the associated eigenvalue interlacing results, to the adjacency and Laplacian matrices of undirected multilayer networks. Specifically, we describe relationships between the eigenvalue spectra of multilayer networks and their two most natural quotients, the network of layers and the aggregate network, and show the dynamical implications of working with either of the two simplified representations. Our work thus contributes in particular to the study of dynamical processes whose critical properties are determined by the spectral properties of the underlying network.},

We study a natural online variant of this problem in which elements arrive one-by-one and the algorithm has to maintain a solution obeying certain constraints at all times. Upon arrival of an element, the algorithm has to decide whether to accept the element into its solution and may preempt previously chosen elements. The goal is to maximize a sub-modular function over the set of elements in the solution. We study two special cases of this general problem and derive upper and lower bounds on the competitive ratio. Specifically, we design a 1/e-competitive algorithm for the unconstrained case in which the algorithm may hold any subset of the elements, and constant competitive ratio algorithms for the case where the algorithm may hold at most k elements in its solution.},

In addition, the decision-making process sometimes has to be made under uncertainty where certain inputs are not known exactly. In this paper, we develop three stochastic multi-objective models for designing transportation network under demand uncertainty. These three stochastic multi-objective NDP models are formulated as the expected value multi-objective programming (EVMOP) model, chance constrained multi-objective programming (CCMOP) model, and dependent chance multi-objective programming (DCMOP) model in a bi-level programming framework using different criteria to hedge against demand uncertainty. To solve these stochastic multi-objective NDP models, we develop a solution approach that explicitly optimizes all objectives under demand uncertainty by simultaneously generating a family of optimal solutions known as the Pareto optimal solution set. Numerical examples are also presented to illustrate the concept of the three stochastic multi-objective NDP models as well as the effectiveness of the solution approach.},

In this paper we consider the question of whether submodular functions can be minimized when given access to its training data. We show that even learnable submodular functions cannot be minimized within any non-trivial approximation when given access to polynomially-many sam-ples. Specifically, we show that there is a class of submodular functions with range in [0, 1] such that, despite being PAC-learnable and minimizable in polynomial-time, no algorithm can obtain an approximation strictly better than 1/2 o(1) using polynomially-many samples drawn from any distribution. Furthermore, we show that this bound is tight via a trivial algorithm that obtains an approximation of 1/2.},

abstract = {The studies in fault-tolerance in networks mostly focus on the connectivity of the graph as the metric of fault-tolerance. If the underlying graph is k-connected, it can tolerate up to k - 1 failures. In measuring the fault tolerance in terms of connectivity, no assumption regarding the locations of the faulty nodes are made - the failed nodes may be close to each other or far from each other. In other words, the connectivity metric has no way of capturing the notion of locality of faults. However in many networks, faults may be highly localized. This is particularly true in military networks, where an enemy bomb may inflict massive but localized damage to the network. To capture the notion of locality of faults in a network, a new metric region-based connectivity (RBC) was introduced in. It was shown that RBC can achieve the same level of fault-tolerance as the metric connectivity, with much lower networking resources. The study in was restricted to single region fault model (SRFM), where faults are confined to one region only. In this paper, we extend the notion of RBC to multiple region fault model (MRFM), where faults are no longer confined to a single region. As faults in MRFM are still confined to regions, albeit multiple of them, it is different from unconstrained fault model where no constraint on locality of faults is imposed. The MRFM leads to several new concepts, such as region-disjoint paths and region cuts. We show that the classical result, the maximum number of node-disjoint paths between a pair of nodes is equal to the minimum number of nodes whose removal disconnects the pair, is no longer valid when region-disjoint paths and region cuts are considered. We prove that the problems of finding (i) the maximum number of region-disjoint paths between a pair of nodes, and (ii) minimum number of regions whose removal disconnect a pair of nodes, are both NP-complete. We provide heuristic solution to these two problems and evaluate their efficacy by compari-\nng the results with optimal solutions.},

In this paper, we propose a model to emphasize the essential difference between information spreading and epidemic spreading, where the memory effects, the social reinforcement and the non-redundancy of contacts are taken into account. Under certain conditions, the information spreads faster and broader in regular networks than in random networks, which to some extent supports the recent experimental observation of spreading in online society [D. Centola, Science {\bf 329}, 1194 (2010)]. At the same time, simulation result indicates that the random networks tend to be favorable for effective spreading when the network size increases. This challenges the validity of the above-mentioned experiment for large-scale systems. More significantly, we show that the spreading effectiveness can be sharply enhanced by introducing a little randomness into the regular structure, namely the small-world networks yield the most effective information spreading. Our work provides insights to the understanding of the role of local clustering in information spreading.},

The effort to automate such research, known as AutoML, has also made significant progress. However, this progress has largely focused on the architecture of neural networks, where it has relied on sophisticated expert-designed layers as building blocks---or similarly restrictive search spaces. Our goal is to show that AutoML can go further: it is possible today to automatically discover complete machine learning algorithms just using basic mathematical operations as building blocks. We demonstrate this by introducing a novel framework that significantly reduces human bias through a generic search space. Despite the vastness of this space, evolutionary search can still discover two-layer neural networks trained by backpropagation. These simple neural networks can then be surpassed by evolving directly on tasks of interest, e.g. CIFAR-10 variants, where modern techniques emerge in the top algorithms, such as bilinear interactions, normalized gradients, and weight averaging. Moreover, evolution adapts algorithms to different task types: e.g., dropout-like techniques appear when little data is available. We believe these preliminary successes in discovering machine learning algorithms from scratch indicate a promising new direction for the field.},

abstract = {Smart grid addresses the problem of existing power grid's increasing complexity, growing demand, and requirement for greater reliability through two-way communication and automated residential load control among others. These features also make the smart grid a target for a number of cyber attacks. In this paper, we study the problem of price modification attack (PMA) through fabrication of price messages, which induces changes in load profiles of individual users and eventually causes major alteration in the load profile of the entire network. Combining with cascading failure, it ends up with a highly damaging attack. We prove that the problem is nondeterministic polynomial-time-complete and provide its inapproximability. We devise two approaches for the problem, the former deals with maximizing failure of lines with the given resource and then extending the effect with cascading failure, while the later takes cascading potential into account while choosing the lines to fail. We formulate new protection strategy against PMA and this includes two new algorithms, namely bi-level programming with new branching method and an effective heuristic to improve the running time. Empirical results on both IEEE bus data and real network help us evaluate our approaches under various settings of grid parameters.},

abstract = {Symmetric positive-definite (SPD) matrices are ubiquitous in Computer Vision, Machine Learning and Medical Image Analysis. Finding the center/average of a population of such matrices is a common theme in many algorithms such as clustering, segmentation, principal geodesic analysis, etc. The center of a population of such matrices can be defined using a variety of distance/divergence measures as the minimizer of the sum of squared distances/divergences from the unknown center to the members of the population. It is well known that the computation of the Karcher mean for the space of SPD matrices which is a negatively-curved Riemannian manifold is computationally expensive. Recently, the LogDet divergence-based center was shown to be a computationally attractive alternative. However, the LogDet-based mean of more than two matrices can not be computed in closed form, which makes it computationally less attractive for large populations. In this paper we present a novel recursive estimator for center based on the Stein distance - which is the square root of the LogDet divergence - that is significantly faster than the batch mode computation of this center. The key theoretical contribution is a closed-form solution for the weighted Stein center of two SPD matrices, which is used in the recursive computation of the Stein center for a population of SPD matrices. Additionally, we show experimental evidence of the convergence of our recursive Stein center estimator to the batch mode Stein center. We present applications of our recursive estimator to K-means clustering and image indexing depicting significant time gains over corresponding algorithms that use the batch mode computations. For the latter application, we develop novel hashing functions using the Stein distance and apply it to publicly available data sets, and experimental results have shown favorable comparisons to other competing methods.},

In order to do this, we introduce the concept of even 1‐factorizations. An even 1‐factor of a digraph is a spanning subgraph consisting of vertex disjoint loops and even cycles; an even 1‐factorization is a partition of the arcs into even 1‐factors. We prove that if a digraph admits an even 1‐factorization, then so does its line digraph.

abstract = {In this paper, we study the set cover problem in the fully dynamic model. In this model, the set of active elements, i.e., those that must be covered at any given time, can change due to element arrivals and departures. The goal is to maintain an algorithmic solution that is competitive with respect to the current optimal solution. This model is popular in both the dynamic algorithms and online algorithms communities. The difference is in the restriction placed on the algorithm: in dynamic algorithms, the running time of the algorithm making updates (called update time) is bounded, while in online algorithms, the number of updates made to the solution (called recourse) is limited. In this paper we show the following results: In the update time setting, we obtain O(log n)-competitiveness with O(f log n) amortized update time, and O(f^3)-competitiveness with O(f^2) update time. The O(log n)-competitive algorithm is the first one to achieve a competitive ratio independent of f in this setting. In the recourse setting, we show a competitive ratio of O(min{log n,f}) with constant amortized recourse. Note that this matches the best offline bounds with just constant recourse, something that is impossible in the classical online model. Our results are based on two algorithmic frameworks in the fully-dynamic model that are inspired by the classic greedy and primal-dual algorithms for offline set cover. We show that both frameworks can be used for obtaining both recourse and update time bounds, thereby demonstrating algorithmic techniques common to these strands of research.},

Instead, they all assumed known rates (either constants or drawn from known distributions) for influence propagation models. However, such models cannot correctly describe influence diffusion in reality. In this paper, we propose a novel model, Dynamic Influence Propagation (DIP), that allows propagation rate to change during the diffusion, based on which we define a new problem: Threshold Activation Problem under DIP (TAP-DIP), which adds another layer of complexity over the already \#P-Hard TAP problem. Despite the hardness of TAP-DIP, we are able to design a Lipschitz Optimization scheme (LOS) that can solve TAP-DIP with $O(\log|V|)$ ratio where $V$ is the set of nodes in the OSN. Using various real OSN datasets, we experimentally demonstrate that LOS not only generates high-quality yet much smaller seed sets when being aware of the rate increase, but also scalable.},

It contains elegant combinatorial theory, useful and interesting algorithms, and deep results about the intrinsic complexity of combinatorial problems. Its clarity of exposition and excellent selection of exercises will make it accessible and appealing to all those with a taste for mathematics and algorithms. Richard Karp,University Professor, University of California at Berkeley Following the development of basic combinatorial optimization techniques in the 1960s and 1970s, a main open question was to develop a theory of approximation algorithms. In the 1990s, parallel developments in techniques for designing approximation algorithms as well as methods for proving hardness of approximation results have led to a beautiful theory. The need to solve truly large instances of computationally hard problems, such as those arising from the Internet or the human genome project, has also increased interest in this theory. The field is currently very active, with the toolbox of approximation algorithm design techniques getting always richer. It is a pleasure to recommend Vijay Vazirani's well-written and comprehensive book on this important and timely topic. I am sure the reader will find it most useful both as an introduction to approximability as well as a reference to the many aspects of approximation algorithms.

abstract = {The problem of deploying sensors in a large water distribution network is considered, in order to detect the malicious introduction of contaminants. It is shown that a large class of realistic objective functions-such as reduction of detection time and the population protected from consuming contaminated water-exhibits an important diminishing returns effect called submodularity. The submodularity of these objectives is exploited in order to design efficient placement algorithms with provable performance guarantees. The algorithms presented in this paper do not rely on mixed integer programming, and scale well to networks of arbitrary size. The problem instances considered in the approach presented in this paper are orders of magnitude (a factor of 72) larger than the largest problems solved in the literature. It is shown how the method presented here can be extended to multicriteria optimization, selecting placements robust to sensor failures and optimizing minimax criteria. Extensive empirical evidence on the effectiveness of the method presented in this paper on two benchmark distribution networks, and an actual drinking water distribution system of greater than 21,000 nodes, is presented.},

abstract = {The majority of influence maximization (IM) studies focus on targeting influential seeders to trigger substantial information spread in social networks. In this paper, we consider a new and complementary problem of how to further increase the influence spread of given seeders. Our study is motivated by the observation that direct incentives could "boost" users so that they are more likely to be influenced by friends. We study the $k$-boosting problem which aims to find $k$ users to boost so that the final "boosted" influence spread is maximized. The $k$-boosting problem is different from the IM problem because boosted users behave differently from seeders: boosted users are initially uninfluenced and we only increase their probability to be influenced. Our work also complements the IM studies because we focus on triggering larger influence spread on the basis of given seeders. Both the NP-hardness of the problem and the non-submodularity of the objective function pose challenges to the $k$-boosting problem. To tackle the problem on general graphs, we devise two efficient algorithms with the data-dependent approximation ratio. For the $k$-boosting problem on bidirected trees, we present an efficient greedy algorithm and a rounded dynamic programming that is a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme. We conduct extensive experiments using real social networks and synthetic bidirected trees. We show that boosting solutions returned by our algorithms achieves boosts of influence that are up to several times higher than those achieved by boosting solutions returned by intuitive baselines, which have no guarantee of solution quality. We also explore the "budget allocation" problem in our experiments. Compared with targeting seeders with all budget, larger influence spread is achieved when we allocation the budget to both seeders and boosted users.},

Using a network derived from 2,000 transcriptional profiles we identify SPDEF, ER$\alpha$, FOXA1, GATA3 and PTTG1 as master regulators of fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 signalling, and show that ER$\alpha$ occupancy responds to fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 signalling. Our results indicate that ER$\alpha$, FOXA1 and GATA3 contribute to the regulation of breast cancer susceptibility genes, which is consistent with the effects of anti-oestrogen treatment in breast cancer prevention, and suggest that fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 signalling has an important role in mediating breast cancer risk. {\textcopyright} 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

The procedure unveils an universal relation among clustering and degree-degree correlations for all networks, where the level of assortativity establishes an upper limit to the level of clustering.

Information reaches us through connections in our social networks, as well as through the influence external out-of-network sources, like the mainstream media. While most present models of information adoption in networks assume information only passes from a node to node via the edges of the underlying network, the recent availability of massive online social media data allows us to study this process in more detail. We present a model in which information can reach a node via the links of the social network or through the influence of external sources. We then develop an efficient model parameter fitting technique and apply the model to the emergence of URL mentions in the Twitter network. Using a complete one month trace of Twitter we study how information reaches the nodes of the network. We quantify the external influences over time and describe how these influences affect the information adoption. We discover that the information tends to "jump" across the network, which can only be explained as an effect of an unobservable external influence on the network. We find that only about 71% of the information volume in Twitter can be attributed to network diffusion, and the remaining 29% is due to external events and factors outside the network. {\textcopyright} 2012 ACM.},

abstract = {In many real-world situations, different and often opposite opinions, innovations, or products are competing with one another for their social influence in a networked society. In this paper, we study competitive influence propagation in social networks under the competitive linear threshold (CLT) model, an extension to the classic linear threshold model. Under the CLT model, we focus on the problem that one entity tries to block the influence propagation of its competing entity as much as possible by strategically selecting a number of seed nodes that could initiate its own influence propagation. We call this problem the influence blocking maximization (IBM) problem. We prove that the objective function of IBM in the CLT model is submodular, and thus a greedy algorithm could achieve 1-1/e approximation ratio. However, the greedy algorithm requires Monte-Carlo simulations of competitive influence propagation, which makes the algorithm not efficient. We design an efficient algorithm CLDAG, which utilizes the properties of the CLT model, to address this issue. We conduct extensive simulations of CLDAG, the greedy algorithm, and other baseline algorithms on real-world and synthetic datasets. Our results show that CLDAG is able to provide best accuracy in par with the greedy algorithm and often better than other algorithms, while it is two orders of magnitude faster than the greedy algorithm.},

Approximate submodularity implicitly appears in a wide range of applications as in many cases errors in evaluation of a submodular function break submodularity. Say that $F$ is $\eps$-approximately submodular if there exists a submodular function $f$ such that $(1-\eps)f(S) \leq F(S)\leq (1+\eps)f(S)$ for all subsets $S$. We are interested in characterizing the query-complexity of maximizing $F$ subject to a cardinality constraint $k$ as a function of the error level $\eps > 0$. We provide both lower and upper bounds: for $\eps > n^{-1/2}$ we show an exponential query-complexity lower bound. In contrast, when $\eps < {1}/{k}$ or under a stronger bounded curvature assumption, we give constant approximation algorithms.},

abstract = {The theory of reinforcement learning provides a normative account, deeply rooted in psychological and neuroscientific perspectives on animal behaviour, of how agents may optimize their control of an environment. To use reinforcement learning successfully in situations approaching real-world complexity, however, agents are confronted with a difficult task: they must derive efficient representations of the environment from high-dimensional sensory inputs, and use these to generalize past experience to new situations. Remarkably, humans and other animals seem to solve this problem through a harmonious combination of reinforcement learning and hierarchical sensory processing systems, the former evidenced by a wealth of neural data revealing notable parallels between the phasic signals emitted by dopaminergic neurons and temporal difference reinforcement learning algorithms. While reinforcement learning agents have achieved some successes in a variety of domains, their applicability has previously been limited to domains in which useful features can be handcrafted, or to domains with fully observed, low-dimensional state spaces. Here we use recent advances in training deep neural networks to develop a novel artificial agent, termed a deep Q-network, that can learn successful policies directly from high-dimensional sensory inputs using end-to-end reinforcement learning. We tested this agent on the challenging domain of classic Atari 2600 games. We demonstrate that the deep Q-network agent, receiving only the pixels and the game score as inputs, was able to surpass the performance of all previous algorithms and achieve a level comparable to that of a professional human games tester across a set of 49 games, using the same algorithm, network architecture and hyperparameters. This work bridges the divide between high-dimensional sensory inputs and actions, resulting in the first artificial agent that is capable of learning to excel at a diverse array of challenging tasks.},

From Menger's theorem both problems are equivalent (and computationally easy) in the unbounded case for single source, single target paths. However, in the bounded case, they are combinatorially distinct and are both NP-hard, even to approximate. Our results indicate that a more refined landscape appears when we study these problems with respect to their parameterized complexity. For this, we consider several parameterizations (with respect to the maximum length l of paths, the number k of paths or the size of a cut, and the treewidth of the input graph) of all variants of both problems (edge/vertex-disjoint paths or cuts, directed/undirected). We provide FPT-algorithms (for all variants) when parameterized by both k and l and hardness results when the parameter is only one of k and l. Our results indicate that the bounded length disjoint-path variants are structurally harder than their bounded length cut counterparts. Also, it appears that the edge variants are harder than their vertex-disjoint counterparts when parameterized by the treewidth of the input graph. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {We study the problem of finding a maximum matching in a graph given by an input stream listing its edges in some arbitrary order, where the quantity to be maximized is given by a monotone submodular function on subsets of edges. This problem, which we call maximum submodular-function matching (MSM), is a natural generalization of maximum weight matching (MWM), which is in turn a generalization of maximum cardinality matching. We give two incomparable algorithms for this problem with space usage falling in the semi-streaming range—they store only $$O(n)$$O(n) edges, using (Formula presented.) working memory—that achieve approximation ratios of 7.75 in a single pass and (Formula presented.) in (Formula presented.) passes respectively. The operations of these algorithms mimic those of Zelke's and McGregor's respective algorithms for MWM; the novelty lies in the analysis for the MSM setting. In fact we identify a general framework for MWM algorithms that allows this kind of adaptation to the broader setting of MSM. Our framework is not specific to matchings. Rather, we identify a general pattern for algorithms that maximize linear weight functions over “independent sets” and prove that such algorithms can be adapted to maximize a submodular function. The notion of independence here is very general; in particular, appealing to known weight-maximization algorithms, we obtain results for submodular maximization over hypermatchings in hypergraphs as well as independent sets in the intersection of multiple matroids.},

Recent work has demonstrated that under perfect information (which nodes are/are not infected), the budget required for curing a graph precisely depends on its CutWidth. We develop a model for observation uncertainty, and show that even a minor degradation in the assumption of perfect knowledge of the state of the infection drastically alters the landscape -- infections that could previously be cured in sublinear time, now may require exponential time to cure. Our main result characterizes the necessary curing budget required as a function of the per-node observation uncertainty.},

Its applications include developing de Bruijn graph genome assemblers, fast multiple sequence alignment and repeat detection. The tremendous amounts of NGS data require fast algorithms for $k$-mer counting, preferably using moderate amounts of memory. Results: We present a novel method for $k$-mer counting, on large datasets at least twice faster than the strongest competitors (Jellyfish$\sim$2, KMC$\sim$1), using about 12\,GB (or less) of RAM memory. Our disk-based method bears some resemblance to MSPKmerCounter, yet replacing the original minimizers with signatures (a carefully selected subset of all minimizers) and using $(k, x)$-mers allows to significantly reduce the I/O, and a highly parallel overall architecture allows to achieve unprecedented processing speeds. For example, KMC$\sim$2 allows to count the 28-mers of a human reads collection with 44-fold coverage (106\,GB of compressed size) in about 20 minutes, on a 6-core Intel i7 PC with an SSD.

The proposed method is called improved ant colony optimizations (IACO) which introduces two addition techniques in order to improve the search process, i.e. neighborhood search and re-initialization process. To show its efficiency, IACO is applied to test with three different topology network systems and its results are compared with those obtained results from the conventional approaches, i.e. genetic algorithm (GA), tabu search algorithm (TSA) and ACO.

abstract = {The security issue of complex networks has drawn significant concerns recently. While pure topological analyzes from a network security perspective provide some effective techniques, their inability to characterize the physical principles requires a more comprehensive model to approximate failure behavior of a complex network in reality. In this paper, based on an extended topological metric, we proposed an approach to examine the vulnerability of a specific type of complex network, i.e., the power system, against cascading failure threats. The proposed approach adopts a model called extended betweenness that combines network structure with electrical characteristics to define the load of power grid components. By using this power transfer distribution factor-based model, we simulated attacks on different components (buses and branches) in the grid and evaluated the vulnerability of the system components with an extended topological cascading failure simulator. Influence of different loading and overloading situations on cascading failures was also evaluated by testing different tolerance factors. Simulation results from a standard IEEE 118-bus test system revealed the vulnerability of network components, which was then validated on a dc power flow simulator with comparisons to other topological measurements. Finally, potential extensions of the approach were also discussed to exhibit both utility and challenge in more complex scenarios and applications.},

abstract = {We study the power of fractional allocations of resources to maximize influence in a network. This work extends in a natural way the well-studied model by Kempe, Kleinberg, and Tardos (2003), where a designer selects a (small) seed set of nodes in a social network to influence directly, this influence cascades when other nodes reach certain thresholds of neighbor influence, and the goal is to maximize the final number of influenced nodes. Despite extensive study from both practical and theoretical viewpoints, this model limits the designer to a binary choice for each node, with no way to apply intermediate levels of influence. This model captures some settings precisely, e.g. exposure to an idea or pathogen, but it fails to capture very relevant concerns in others, for example, a manufacturer promoting a new product by distributing five "20% off" coupons instead of giving away one free product. While fractional versions of problems tend to be easier to solve than integral versions, for influence maximization, we show that the two versions have essentially the same computational complexity. On the other hand, the two versions can have vastly different solutions: the added flexibility of fractional allocation can lead to significantly improved influence. Our main theoretical contribution is to show how to adapt the major positive results from the integral case to the fractional case. Specifically, Mossel and Roch (2006) used the submodularity of influence to obtain their integral results; we introduce a new notion of continuous submodularity, and use this to obtain matching fractional results. We conclude that we can achieve the same greedy $(1-1/e-\epsilon)$-approximation for the fractional case as the integral case. In practice, we find that the fractional model performs substantially better than the integral model, according to simulations on real-world social network data.},

Each layer is a weighted digraph associated with a strain of virus; the weights gz$\iota$́represent the rates of infection from node i to node j of strain z. We establish a sufficient condition on the g's that guarantees survival of the fittest-only one strain survives. We propose an ordering of the weighted digraphs, the *-order, and show that if the weighted digraph of strain y is *-dominated by the weighted digraph of strain x, then y dies out in the long run. We prove that the orbits of the ODE accumulate to an attractor that captures the survival of the fittest phenomenon. Due to the coupled nonlinear high-dimension nature of the ODEs, there is no natural Lyapunov function to study their global qualitative behavior. We prove our results by combining two important properties of these ODEs: (i) monotonicity under a partial ordering on the set of graphs; and (ii) dimension-reduction under symmetry of the graphs. Property (ii) allows us to fully address the survival of the fittest for regular graphs. Then, by bounding the epidemics dynamics for generic networks by the dynamics on regular networks, we prove the result for general networks.},

Many efficient solutions to common problems involve using hand-crafted heuristics to sequentially construct a solution. Therefore, it is intriguing to see how a combinatorial optimization problem can be formulated as a sequential decision making process and whether efficient heuristics can be implicitly learned by a reinforcement learning agent to find a solution. This survey explores the synergy between CO and reinforcement learning (RL) framework, which can become a promising direction for solving combinatorial problems.},

abstract = {There are many applications (e.g., counter-terrorism) where we can automatically learn a quantitative model from realworld data about terror group behavior. In this paper, we first provide a survey of quantitative models of terrorist groups. To date, however, the best-known quantitative models of terror group behavior are based on various types of quantitative logic programs. After our survey, we address an important question posed to us by Nobel laureate, Tom Schelling. Once a set of quantitative logic behavior rules about an adversary has been learned, should these rules be disclosed or not? We develop a game theoretic framework in order to answer this question with a defender who has to decide what rules to release publicly and which ones to keep hidden. We first study the attacker's optimal attack strategy, given a set of disclosed rules, and then we study the problem of which rules to disclose so that the attacker's optimal strategy has minimal effectiveness. We study the complexity of both problems, present algorithms to solve both, and then present a (1-1/e )-approximation algorithm that (under some restrictions) uses a submodularity property to compute the optimal defender strategy. Finally, we provide experimental results showing that our framework works well in practice-these results are also shown to be statistically significant.},

This book provides a comprehensive introduction to the subject, and shows in detail how such problems can be solved numerically with great efficiency. The book begins with the basic elements of convex sets and functions, and then describes various classes of convex optimization problems. Duality and approximation techniques are then covered, as are statistical estimation techniques. Various geometrical problems are then presented, and there is detailed discussion of unconstrained and constrained minimization problems, and interior-point methods. The focus of the book is on recognizing convex optimization problems and then finding the most appropriate technique for solving them. It contains many worked examples and homework exercises and will appeal to students, researchers and practitioners in fields such as engineering, computer science, mathematics, statistics, finance, and economics.

Tree-based planning methods have enjoyed huge success in challenging domains, such as chess and Go, where a perfect simulator is available. However, in real-world problems the dynamics governing the environment are often complex and unknown. In this work we present the MuZero algorithm which, by combining a tree-based search with a learned model, achieves superhuman performance in a range of challenging and visually complex domains, without any knowledge of their underlying dynamics. MuZero learns a model that, when applied iteratively, predicts the quantities most directly relevant to planning: the reward, the action-selection policy, and the value function. When evaluated on 57 different Atari games - the canonical video game environment for testing AI techniques, in which model-based planning approaches have historically struggled - our new algorithm achieved a new state of the art. When evaluated on Go, chess and shogi, without any knowledge of the game rules, MuZero matched the superhuman performance of the AlphaZero algorithm that was supplied with the game rules.},

On the empirical side, while both AGCD and ASCD outperform Accelerated Randomized Coordinate Descent on most instances in our numerical experiments, we note that AGCD significantly outperforms the other two methods in our experiments, in spite of a lack of theoretical guarantees for this method. To complement this empirical finding for AGCD, we present an explanation why standard proof techniques for acceleration cannot work for AGCD, and we introduce a technical condition under which AGCD is guaranteed to have accelerated convergence. Finally, we confirm that this technical condition holds in our numerical experiments.},

This perspective grants women little agency and neglects their simultaneous location in other social structures. In this article we synthesize insights from social psychology, gender, and culture to argue that undergrad- uate women use slut stigma to draw boundaries around status groups linked to social class—while also regulating sexual behavior and gender performance. High-status women employ slut discourse to assert class advantage, defining themselves as classy rather than tra- shy, while low-status women express class resentment—deriding rich, bitchy sluts for their exclusivity. Slut discourse enables, rather than constrains, sexual experimentation for the high-status women whose definitions prevail in the dominant social scene. This is a form of sexual privilege. In contrast, low-status women risk public shaming when they attempt to enter dominant social worlds.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 Valba et al. Background: Connectivity networks, which reflect multiple interactions between genes and proteins, possess not only a descriptive but also a predictive value, as new connections can be extrapolated and tested by means of computational analysis. Integration of different types of connectivity data (such as co-expression and genetic interactions) in one network has proven to benefit 'guilt by association' analysis. However predictive values of connectives of different types, that had their specific functional meaning and topological characteristics were not obvious, and have been addressed in this analysis. Methods: eQTL data for 3 experimental C.elegans age groups were retrieved from WormQTL. WormNet has been used to obtain pair-wise gene interactions. The Shortest Path Function (SPF) has been adopted for statistical validation of the co-expressed gene clusters and for computational prediction of their potential gene expression regulators from a n etwork context. A new SPF-based algorithm has been applied to genetic interactions sub-networks adjacent to the clusters of co-expressed genes for ranking the most likely gene expression regulators causal to eQTLs. Results: We have demonstrated that known co-expression and genetic interactions between C. Elegans genes can be complementary in predicting gene expression regulators. Several algorithms were compared in respect to their predictive potential in different network connectivity contexts. We found that genes associated with eQTLs are highly clustered in a C. Elegans co-expression sub-network, and their adjacent genetic interactions provide the optimal functional connectivity environment for application of the new SPF-based algorithm. It was successfully tested in the reverse-prediction analysis on groups of genes with known regulators and applied to co-expressed genes and experimentally observed expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). Conclusions: This analysis demonstrates differences in topology and connectivity of co-expression and genetic interactions sub-networks in WormNet. The modularity of less continuous genetic interaction network does not correspond to modularity of the dense network comprised by gene co-expression interactions. However the genetic interaction network can be used much more efficiently with the SPF method in prediction of potential regulators of gene expression. The developed method can be used for validation of functional significance of suggested eQTLs and a discovery of new regulatory modules.},

abstract = {Shannon's entropy is a clear lower bound for statistical compression. The situation is not so well understood for dictionary-based compression. A plausible lower bound is b, the least number of phrases of a general bidirectional parse of a text, where phrases can be copied from anywhere else in the text. Since computing b is NP-complete, a popular gold standard is z, the number of phrases in the Lempel-Ziv parse of the text, which is the optimal one when phrases can be copied only from the left. While z can be computed in linear time with a greedy algorithm, almost nothing has been known for decades about its approximation ratio with respect to b. In this paper we prove that z = O(b log(n/b)), where n is the text length. We also show that the bound is tight as a function of n, by exhibiting a string family where z = {\Omega}(b log n). Our upper bound is obtained by building a run-length context-free grammar based on a locally consistent parsing of the text. Our lower bound is obtained by relating b with r, the number of equal-letter runs in the Burrows-Wheeler transform of the text. We proceed by observing that Lempel-Ziv is just one particular case of greedy parse, and introduce a new parse where phrases can only be copied from lexicographically smaller text locations. We prove that the size v of the smallest parse of this kind has properties similar to z, including the same approximation ratio with respect to b. Interestingly, we also show that v = O(r), whereas r = o(z) holds on some particular classes of strings. On our way, we prove other relevant bounds between compressibility measures.},

abstract = {Balkanski and Singer [5] recently initiated the study of adaptivity (or parallelism) for constrained submodular function maximization, and studied the setting of a cardinality constraint. Very recent improvements for this problem by Balkanski, Rubinstein, and Singer [6] and Ene and Nguyen [21] resulted in a near-optimal $(1-1/e-\epsilon)$-approximation in $O(\log n/\epsilon^2)$ rounds of adaptivity. Partly motivated by the goal of extending these results to more general constraints, we describe parallel algorithms for approximately maximizing the multilinear relaxation of a monotone submodular function subject to packing constraints. Formally our problem is to maximize $F(x)$ over $x \in [0,1]^{n}$ subject to $Ax \le 1$ where $F$ is the multilinear relaxation of a monotone submodular function. Our algorithm achieves a near-optimal $(1-1/e-\epsilon)$-approximation in $O(\log^2 m \log n/\epsilon^4)$ rounds where $n$ is the cardinality of the ground set and $m$ is the number of packing constraints. For many constraints of interest, the resulting fractional solution can be rounded via known randomized rounding schemes that are oblivious to the specific submodular function. We thus derive randomized algorithms with poly-logarithmic adaptivity for a number of constraints including partition and laminar matroids, matchings, knapsack constraints, and their intersections.},

We show simple convex counter-examples where signSGD does not converge to the optimum. Further, even when it does converge, signSGD may generalize poorly when compared with SGD. These issues arise because of the biased nature of the sign compression operator. We then show that using error-feedback, i.e. incorporating the error made by the compression operator into the next step, overcomes these issues. We prove that our algorithm EF-SGD achieves the same rate of convergence as SGD without any additional assumptions for arbitrary compression operators (including the sign operator), indicating that we get gradient compression for free. Our experiments thoroughly substantiate the theory showing the superiority of our algorithm.},

Unfortunately, the last comprehensive empirical evaluation of supervised learning was the Statlog Project in the early 90's. We present a large-scale empirical comparison between ten supervised learning methods: SVMs, neural nets, logistic regression, naive bayes, memory-based learning, random forests, decision trees, bagged trees, boosted trees, and boosted stumps. We also examine the effect that calibrating the models via Platt Scaling and Isotonic Regression has on their performance. An important aspect of our study is the use of a variety of performance criteria to evaluate the learning methods.},

abstract = {In this paper we study submodular maximization under a matroid constraint in the adaptive complexity model. This model was recently introduced in the context of submodular optimization in [BS18a] to quantify the information theoretic complexity of black-box optimization in a parallel computation model. Informally, the adaptivity of an algorithm is the number of sequential rounds it makes when each round can execute polynomially-many function evaluations in parallel. Since submodular optimization is regularly applied on large datasets we seek algorithms with low adaptivity to enable speedups via parallelization. Consequently, a recent line of work has been devoted to designing constant factor approximation algorithms for maximizing submodular functions under various constraints in the adaptive complexity model [BS18a, BS18b, BBS18, BRS19, EN19, FMZ19, CQ19, ENV18, FMZ18]. Despite the burst in work on submodular maximization in the adaptive complexity model the fundamental problem of maximizing a monotone submodular function under a matroid constraint has remained elusive. In particular, all known techniques fail for this problem and there are no known constant factor approximation algorithms whose adaptivity is sublinear in the rank of the matroid $k$ or in the worst case sublinear in the size of the ground set $n$. In this paper we present an approximation algorithm for the problem of maximizing a monotone submodular function under a matroid constraint in the adaptive complexity model. The approximation guarantee of the algorithm is arbitrarily close to the optimal $1-1/e$ and it has near optimal adaptivity of $O(\log(n)\log(k))$. This result is obtained using a novel technique of adaptive sequencing which departs from previous techniques for submodular maximization in the adaptive complexity model.},

Compared to the continuous greedy algorithm (Calinescu, Chekuri, Pal and Vondrak, 2008), our algorithm is extremely simple and requires no rounding. It consists of the greedy algorithm followed by local search. Both phases are run not on the actual objective function, but on a related non-oblivious potential function, which is also monotone sub modular. In our previous work on maximum coverage (Filmus and Ward, 2011), the potential function gives more weight to elements covered multiple times. We generalize this approach from coverage functions to arbitrary monotone sub modular functions. When the objective function is a coverage function, both definitions of the potential function coincide. The parameters used to define the potential function are closely related to Pade approximants of exp(x) evaluated at x = 1. We use this connection to determine the approximation ratio of the algorithm. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: It is well understood that distinct communities of bacteria are present at different sites of the body, and that changes in the structure of these communities have strong implications for human health. Yet, challenges remain in understanding the complex interconnections between the bacterial taxa within these microbial communities and how they change during the progression of diseases. Many recent studies attempt to analyze the human microbiome using traditional ecological measures and cataloging differences in bacterial community membership. In this paper, we show how to push metagenomic analyses beyond mundane questions related to the bacterial taxonomic profiles that differentiate one sample from another.\n\nMETHODS: We develop tools and techniques that help us to investigate the nature of social interactions in microbial communities, and demonstrate ways of compactly capturing extensive information about these networks and visually conveying them in an effective manner. We define the concept of bacterial "social clubs", which are groups of taxa that tend to appear together in many samples. More importantly, we define the concept of "rival clubs", entire groups that tend to avoid occurring together in many samples. We show how to efficiently compute social clubs and rival clubs and demonstrate their utility with the help of examples including a smokers' dataset and a dataset from the Human Microbiome Project (HMP).\n\nRESULTS: The tools developed provide a framework for analyzing relationships between bacterial taxa modeled as bacterial co-occurrence networks. The computational techniques also provide a framework for identifying clubs and rival clubs and for studying differences in the microbiomes (and their interactions) of two or more collections of samples.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Microbial relationships are similar to those found in social networks. In this work, we assume that strong (positive or negative) tendencies to co-occur or co-infect is likely to have biological, physiological, or ecological significance, possibly as a result of cooperation or competition. As a consequence of the analysis, a variety of biological interpretations are conjectured. In the human microbiome context, the pattern of strength of interactions between bacterial taxa is unique to body site.},

A collection of triangles in G (repetition allowed) is called a triangle packing of (G, w) if each edge e ∈ E appears in at most w(e) members of the collection.

In order to investigate this phenomenon, we measured how social influence predicts attitudes, use and further exercise in the context of gamification of exercise. Our results show that people indeed do "work out for likes", or in other words, social influence, positive recognition and reciprocity have a positive impact on how much people are willing to exercise as well as their attitudes and willingness to use gamification services. Moreover, we found that the more friends a user has in the service, the larger the effects are. Furthermore, the findings of the empirical study further provide new understanding on the phenomenon of social influence in technology adoption/use continuance in general by showing, in addition to subjective norms, how getting recognized, receiving reciprocal benefits and network effects contribute to use continuance.},

abstract = {With the wide applications of large scale graph data such as social networks, the problem of finding the top-k shortest paths attracts increasing attention. This paper focuses on the discovery of the top-k simple shortest paths (paths without loops). The well known algorithm for this problem is due to Yen, and the provided worst-case bound O(kn(m + nlogn)), which comes from O(n) times single-source shortest path discovery for each of k shortest paths, remains unbeaten for 30 years, where n is the number of nodes and m is the number of edges. In this paper, we observe that there are shared sub-paths among O(kn) single-source shortest paths. The basic idea behind our method is to pre-compute the shortest paths to the target node, and utilize them to reduce the discovery cost at running time. Specifically, we transform the original graph by encoding the pre-computed paths, and prove that the shortest path discovered over the transformed graph is equivalent to that in the original graph. Most importantly, the path discovery over the transformed graph can be terminated much earlier than before. In addition, two optimization strategies are presented. One is to reduce the total iteration times for shortest path discovery, and the other is to prune the search space in each iteration with an adaptively-determined threshold. Although the worst-case complexity cannot be lowered, our method is proven to be much more efficient in a general case. The final extensive experimental results (on both real and synthetic graphs) also show that our method offers a significant performance improvement over the existing ones. {\textcopyright} 2010 ACM.},

We establish upper and lower bounds for the approximability of these problems with a polynomial number of queries to a function-value oracle. The approximation guarantees that most of our algorithms achieve are of the order of $\sqrt{{n}/{\ln n}}$.

Further, clustered networks can amplify small homophilic bias for trait assortativity. This marked asymmetry suggests that transitivity, rather than homophily, drives the standard nonsocial/social network dichotomy.},

abstract = {Much of recent machine learning has focused on deep learning, in which neural network weights are trained through variants of stochastic gradient descent. An alternative approach comes from the field of neuroevolution, which harnesses evolutionary algorithms to optimize neural networks, inspired by the fact that natural brains themselves are the products of an evolutionary process. Neuroevolution enables important capabilities that are typically unavailable to gradient-based approaches, including learning neural network building blocks (for example activation functions), hyperparameters, architectures and even the algorithms for learning themselves. Neuroevolution also differs from deep learning (and deep reinforcement learning) by maintaining a population of solutions during search, enabling extreme exploration and massive parallelization. Finally, because neuroevolution research has (until recently) developed largely in isolation from gradient-based neural network research, it has developed many unique and effective techniques that should be effective in other machine learning areas too. This Review looks at several key aspects of modern neuroevolution, including large-scale computing, the benefits of novelty and diversity, the power of indirect encoding, and the field's contributions to meta-learning and architecture search. Our hope is to inspire renewed interest in the field as it meets the potential of the increasing computation available today, to highlight how many of its ideas can provide an exciting resource for inspiration and hybridization to the deep learning, deep reinforcement learning and machine learning communities, and to explain how neuroevolution could prove to be a critical tool in the long-term pursuit of artificial general intelligence.},

Despite that several individual-level diffusion data have been investigated, we still lack the detailed understanding of the spreading pattern of information. Here, by comparing information flows and social links in a blog community, we find that the diffusion processes are induced by three different spreading mechanisms: social spreading, self-promotion and broadcast. Although numerous previous studies have employed epidemic spreading models to simulate information diffusion, we observe that such models fail to reproduce the realistic diffusion pattern. In respect to users behaviors, strikingly, we find that most users would stick to one specific diffusion mechanism. Moreover, our observations indicate that the social spreading is not only crucial for the structure of diffusion trees, but also capable of inducing more subsequent individuals to acquire the information. Our findings suggest new directions for modeling of information diffusion in social systems, and could inform design of efficient propagation strategies based on users behaviors.},

abstract = {As a generalization of many classic problems in combinatorial optimization, submodular optimization has found a wide range of applications in machine learning (e.g., in feature engineering and active learning). For many large-scale optimization problems, we are often concerned with the adaptivity complexity of an algorithm, which quantifies the number of sequential rounds where polynomially-many independent function evaluations can be executed in parallel. While low adaptivity is ideal, it is not sufficient for a distributed algorithm to be efficient, since in many practical applications of submodular optimization the number of function evaluations becomes prohibitively expensive. Motivated by such applications, we study the adaptivity and query complexity of non-monotone submodular optimization. We provide the first constant approximation algorithm for maximizing a non-monotone submodular function with cardinality constraint $k$ that has nearly-optimal adaptivity complexity $O(\log(n))$. Furthermore, our algorithm makes only $O(\log(k))$ calls per element to the function evaluation oracle in expectation.},

To meet the demands of the body, the sympathetic system is activated and catecholamines stimulate $\beta$-adrenergic receptors ($\beta$-ARs) to increase contractile performance and cardiac output. Although this is beneficial in the acute phase, chronic $\beta$-ARs stimulation initiates a cascade of alterations at the cellular level, resulting in a diminished contractile performance of the heart.},

Most if not all AI problems can easily be formulated within this theory, which reduces the conceptual problems to pure computational ones. Considered problem classes include sequence prediction, strategic games, function minimization, reinforcement and supervised learning.

Assume further that $f$ satisfies the diminishing return property, which is not an immediate consequence of submodularity when the domain is the integer lattice. Given this, we design polynomial-time $(1-1/e-\epsilon)$-approximation algorithms for a cardinality constraint, a polymatroid constraint, and a knapsack constraint. For a cardinality constraint, we also provide a $(1-1/e-\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm with slightly worse time complexity that does not rely on the diminishing return property.},

abstract = {Functional synthesis (FS) aims at generating an implementation from a declarative specification over sets of designated input and output variables. Traditionally, FS tasks are formulated as ∀∃-formulas, where input variables are universally quantified and output variables are existentially quantified. State-of-the-art approaches to FS proceed by eliminating existential quantifiers and extracting Skolem functions, which are then turned into implementations. Related applications benefit from having concise (i.e., compact and comprehensive) Skolem functions. In this paper, we present an approach for extracting concise Skolem functions for FS tasks specified as examples, i.e., tuples of concrete values of integer variables. Our approach builds a decision tree from relationships between inputs and outputs and preconditions that classify all examples into subsets that share the same input-output relationship. We also present an extension that is applied to hybrid FS tasks, which are formulated in part by examples and in part by arbitrary declarative specifications. Our approach is implemented on top of a functional synthesizer AE-VAL and evaluated on a set of reactive synthesis benchmarks enhanced with examples. Solutions produced by our tool are an order of magnitude smaller than ones produced by the baseline AE-VAL.},

abstract = {Low latency analytics on geographically distributed dat- asets (across datacenters, edge clusters) is an upcoming and increasingly important challenge. The dominant approach of aggregating all the data to a single data- center significantly inflates the timeliness of analytics. At the same time, running queries over geo-distributed inputs using the current intra-DC analytics frameworks also leads to high query response times because these frameworks cannot cope with the relatively low and variable capacity of WAN links. We present Iridium, a system for low latency geo-distri- buted analytics. Iridium achieves low query response times by optimizing placement of both data and tasks of the queries. The joint data and task placement op- timization, however, is intractable. Therefore, Iridium uses an online heuristic to redistribute datasets among the sites prior to queries' arrivals, and places the tasks to reduce network bottlenecks during the query's ex- ecution. Finally, it also contains a knob to budget WAN usage. Evaluation across eight worldwide EC2 re- gions using production queries show that Iridium speeds up queries by 3× − 19× and lowers WAN usage by 15%−64% compared to existing baselines.},

abstract = {There is a widespread intuitive sense that different kinds of information spread differently on-line, but it has been difficult to evaluate this question quantitatively since it requires a setting where many different kinds of information spread in a shared environment. Here we study this issue on Twitter, analyzing the ways in which tokens known as hashtags spread on a network defined by the interactions among Twitter users. We find significant variation in the ways that widely-used hashtags on different topics spread. Our results show that this variation is not attributable simply to differences in "stickiness," the probability of adoption based on one or more exposures, but also to a quantity that could be viewed as a kind of "persistence" - the relative extent to which repeated exposures to a hashtag continue to have significant marginal effects. We find that hashtags on politically controversial topics are particularly persistent, with repeated exposures continuing to have unusually large marginal effects on adoption; this provides, to our knowledge, the first large-scale validation of the "complex contagion" principle from sociology, which posits that repeated exposures to an idea are particularly crucial when the idea is in some way controversial or contentious. Among other findings, we discover that hashtags representing the natural analogues of Twitter idioms and neologisms are particularly non-persistent, with the effect of multiple exposures decaying rapidly relative to the first exposure. We also study the subgraph structure of the initial adopters for different widely-adopted hashtags, again finding structural differences across topics. We develop simulation-based and generative models to analyze how the adoption dynamics interact with the network structure of the early adopters on which a hashtag spreads.},

It is therefore natural to ask if the inherent intractability of NP-complete problem is caused by this wide variation. We give a negative answer to this question using the notion of randomized polynomial time reducibility. We show that the problems of distinguishing between instances of SAT having zero or one solution, or of finding solutions to instances of SAT having a unique solution, are as hard as SAT, under randomized reductions. Several corollaries about the difficulty of specific problems follow. For example, computing the parity of the number of solutions of a SAT formula is shown to be NP-hard, and deciding if a SAT formula has a unique solution is shown to be Dp-hard, under randomized reduction. Central to the study of cryptography is the question as to whether there exist NP-problems whose instances have solutions that are unique but are hard to find. Our result can be interpreted as strengthening the belief that such problems exist. ?? 1986.},

abstract = {We study a generalization of covering problems called partial covering. Here we wish to cover only a desired number of elements, rather than covering all elements as in standard covering problems. For example, in k-partial set cover, we wish to choose a minimum number of sets to cover at least k elements. For k-partial set cover, if each element occurs in at most f sets, then we derive a primal-dual f-approximation algorithm (thus implying a 2-approximation for k-partial vertex cover) in polynomial time. Without making any assumption about the number of sets an element is in, for instances where each set has cardinality at most three, we obtain an approximation of 4/3. We also present better-than-2-approximation algorithms for k-partial vertex cover on bounded degree graphs, and for vertex cover on expanders of bounded average degree. We obtain a polynomial-time approximation scheme for k-partial vertex cover on planar graphs, and for covering k points in Rd by disks. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Meta-learning for few-shot learning entails acquiring a prior over previous tasks and experiences, such that new tasks be learned from small amounts of data. However, a critical challenge in few-shot learning is task ambiguity: even when a powerful prior can be meta-learned from a large number of prior tasks, a small dataset for a new task can simply be too ambiguous to acquire a single model (e.g., a classifier) for that task that is accurate. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic meta-learning algorithm that can sample models for a new task from a model distribution. Our approach extends model-agnostic meta-learning, which adapts to new tasks via gradient descent, to incorporate a parameter distribution that is trained via a variational lower bound. At meta-test time, our algorithm adapts via a simple procedure that injects noise into gradient descent, and at meta-training time, the model is trained such that this stochastic adaptation procedure produces samples from the approximate model posterior. Our experimental results show that our method can sample plausible classifiers and regressors in ambiguous few-shot learning problems. We also show how reasoning about ambiguity can also be used for downstream active learning problems.},

abstract = {The question of generalization in machine learning---how algorithms are able to learn predictors from a training sample to make accurate predictions out-of-sample---is revisited in light of the recent breakthroughs in modern machine learning technology. The classical approach to understanding generalization is based on bias-variance trade-offs, where model complexity is carefully calibrated so that the fit on the training sample reflects performance out-of-sample. However, it is now common practice to fit highly complex models like deep neural networks to data with (nearly) zero training error, and yet these interpolating predictors are observed to have good out-of-sample accuracy even for noisy data. How can the classical understanding of generalization be reconciled with these observations from modern machine learning practice? In this paper, we bridge the two regimes by exhibiting a new "double descent" risk curve that extends the traditional U-shaped bias-variance curve beyond the point of interpolation. Specifically, the curve shows that as soon as the model complexity is high enough to achieve interpolation on the training sample---a point that we call the "interpolation threshold"---the risk of suitably chosen interpolating predictors from these models can, in fact, be decreasing as the model complexity increases, often below the risk achieved using non-interpolating models. The double descent risk curve is demonstrated for a broad range of models, including neural networks and random forests, and a mechanism for producing this behavior is posited.},

On the other hand, DPTAS- and Poly-DAPX-completeness have not been studied until now.

We introduce approximation preserving reductions, called FT and DFT, respectively, and prove that, under these new reductions, natural problems are PTAS-complete, or DPTAS-complete. Then, we deal with the existence of intermediate problems under our reductions and we partially answer this question showing that the existence of NPO-intermediate problems under Turing-reductions is a sufficient condition for the existence of intermediate problems under both FT- and DFT-reductions. Finally, we show that MIN COLORING is DAPX-complete under DPTAS-reductions. This is the first DAPX-complete problem that is not simultaneously APX-complete. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Several disease-specific information exchanges now exist on Facebook and other online social networking sites. These new sources of knowledge, support, and engagement have become important for patients living with chronic disease, yet the quality and content of the information provided in these digital arenas are poorly understood. OBJECTIVE: To qualitatively evaluate the content of communication in Facebook communities dedicated to diabetes. DESIGN: We identified the 15 largest Facebook groups focused on diabetes management. For each group, we downloaded the 15 most recent "wall posts" and the 15 most recent discussion topics from the 10 largest groups. PATIENTS: Four hundred eighty unique users were identified in a series of 690 comments from wall posts and discussion topics. MAIN MEASURES: Posts were abstracted and aggregated into a database. Two investigators evaluated the posts, developed a thematic coding scheme, and applied codes to the data. KEY RESULTS: Patients with diabetes, family members, and their friends use Facebook to share personal clinical information, to request disease-specific guidance and feedback, and to receive emotional support. Approximately two-thirds of posts included unsolicited sharing of diabetes management strategies, over 13% of posts provided specific feedback to information requested by other users, and almost 29% of posts featured an effort by the poster to provide emotional support to others as members of a community. Approximately 27% of posts featured some type of promotional activity, generally presented as testimonials advertising non-FDA approved, "natural" products. Clinically inaccurate recommendations were infrequent, but were usually associated with promotion of a specific product or service. Thirteen percent of posts contained requests for personal information from Facebook participants. CONCLUSIONS: Facebook provides a forum for reporting personal experiences, asking questions, and receiving direct feedback for people living with diabetes. However, promotional activity and personal data collection are also common, with no accountability or checks for authenticity.},

Here, we formulate the problem of inferring latent social networks based on network diffusion or disease propagation data. We consider contagions propagating over the edges of an unobserved social network, where we only observe the times when nodes became infected, but not who infected them. Given such node infection times, we then identify the optimal network that best explains the observed data. We present a maximum likelihood approach based on convex programming with a l1-like penalty term that encourages sparsity. Experiments on real and synthetic data reveal that our method near-perfectly recovers the underlying network structure as well as the parameters of the contagion propagation model. Moreover, our approach scales well as it can infer optimal networks of thousands of nodes in a matter of minutes.},

In order to scale the method and keep its benefits, we propose an algorithm (LineBO) that restricts the problem to a sequence of iteratively chosen one-dimensional sub-problems. We show that our algorithm converges globally and obtains a fast local rate when the function is strongly convex. Further, if the objective has an invariant subspace, our method automatically adapts to the effective dimension without changing the algorithm. Our method scales well to high dimensions and makes use of a global Gaussian process model. When combined with the SafeOpt algorithm to solve the sub-problems, we obtain the first safe Bayesian optimization algorithm with theoretical guarantees applicable in high-dimensional settings. We evaluate our method on multiple synthetic benchmarks, where we obtain competitive performance. Further, we deploy our algorithm to optimize the beam intensity of the Swiss Free Electron Laser with up to 40 parameters while satisfying safe operation constraints.},

This effect was minimized when interpersonal network size was taken into consideration. However, for those who have experienced many objective life stressors, the number of Facebook friends emerged as the stronger predictor of perceived social support.

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {We investigate how the final parameters found by stochastic gradient descent are influenced by over-parameterization. We generate families of models by increasing the number of channels in a base network, and then perform a large hyper-parameter search to study how the test error depends on learning rate, batch size, and network width. We find that the optimal SGD hyper-parameters are determined by a "normalized noise scale," which is a function of the batch size, learning rate, and initialization conditions. In the absence of batch normalization, the optimal normalized noise scale is directly proportional to width. Wider networks, with their higher optimal noise scale, also achieve higher test accuracy. These observations hold for MLPs, ConvNets, and ResNets, and for two different parameterization schemes ("Standard" and "NTK"). We observe a similar trend with batch normalization for ResNets. Surprisingly, since the largest stable learning rate is bounded, the largest batch size consistent with the optimal normalized noise scale decreases as the width increases.},

abstract = {Emerging single-molecule sequencing technologies from Pacific Biosciences and Oxford Nanopore have revived interest in long read mapping algorithms. Alignment-based seed-and-extend methods demonstrate good accuracy, but face limited scalability, while faster alignment-free methods typically trade decreased precision for efficiency. In this paper, we combine a fast approximate read mapping algorithm based on minimizers with a novel MinHash identity estimation technique to achieve both scalability and precision. In contrast to prior methods, we develop a mathematical framework that defines the types of mapping targets we uncover, establish probabilistic estimates of p-value and sensitivity , and demonstrate tolerance for alignment error rates up to 20%. With this framework, our algorithm automatically adapts to different minimum length and identity requirements and provides both positional and identity estimates for each mapping reported. For mapping human PacBio reads to the hg38 reference, our method is 290x faster than BWA-MEM with a lower memory footprint and recall rate of 96%. We further demonstrate the scalability of our method by mapping noisy PacBio reads (each ≥ 5 kbp in length) to the complete NCBI RefSeq database containing 838 Gbp of sequence and > 60, 000 genomes.},

abstract = {It is known that greedy methods perform well for maximizing monotone submodular functions. At the same time, such methods perform poorly in the face of non-monotonicity. In this paper, we show - arguably, surprisingly - that invoking the classical greedy algorithm $O(\sqrt{k})$-times leads to the (currently) fastest deterministic algorithm, called Repeated Greedy, for maximizing a general submodular function subject to $k$-independent system constraints. Repeated Greedy achieves $(1 + O(1/\sqrt{k}))k$ approximation using $O(nr\sqrt{k})$ function evaluations (here, $n$ and $r$ denote the size of the ground set and the maximum size of a feasible solution, respectively). We then show that by a careful sampling procedure, we can run the greedy algorithm only once and obtain the (currently) fastest randomized algorithm, called Sample Greedy, for maximizing a submodular function subject to $k$-extendible system constraints (a subclass of $k$-independent system constrains). Sample Greedy achieves $(k + 3)$-approximation with only $O(nr/k)$ function evaluations. Finally, we derive an almost matching lower bound, and show that no polynomial time algorithm can have an approximation ratio smaller than $ k + 1/2 - \varepsilon$. To further support our theoretical results, we compare the performance of Repeated Greedy and Sample Greedy with prior art in a concrete application (movie recommendation). We consistently observe that while Sample Greedy achieves practically the same utility as the best baseline, it performs at least two orders of magnitude faster.},

abstract = {We study the online submodular maximization problem with free disposal under a matroid constraint. Elements from some ground set arrive one by one in rounds, and the algorithm maintains a feasible set that is independent in the underlying matroid. In each round when a new element arrives, the algorithm may accept the new element into its feasible set and possibly remove elements from it, provided that the resulting set is still independent. The goal is to maximize the value of the final feasible set under some monotone submodular function, to which the algorithm has oracle access. For k-uniform matroids, we give a deterministic algorithm with competitive ratio at least 0.2959, and the ratio approaches 1 $\alpha$∞ ≈ 0.3178 as k approaches infinity, improving the previous best ratio of 0.25 by Chakrabarti and Kale (IPCO 2014), Buchbinder et al. (SODA 2015) and Chekuri et al. (ICALP 2015). We also show that our algorithm is optimal among a class of deterministic monotone algorithms that accept a new arriving element only if the objective is strictly increased. Further, we prove that no deterministic monotone algorithm can be strictly better than 0.25-competitive even for partition matroids, the most modest generalization of k-uniform matroids, matching the competitive ratio by Chakrabarti and Kale (IPCO 2014) and Chekuri et al. (ICALP 2015). Interestingly, we show that randomized algorithms are strictly more powerful by giving a (non-monotone) randomized algorithm for partition matroids with ratio 1 $\alpha$∞ ≈ 0.3178. Finally, our techniques can be extended to a more general problem that generalizes both the online sub-modular maximization problem and the online bipar-tite matching problem with free disposal. competitive algorithms for the submodular online bi-partite matching problem.},

abstract = {In this paper we study the problem of local triangle counting in large graphs. Namely, given a large graph G = (V;E) we want to estimate as accurately as possible the number of triangles incident to every node $\upsilon$ ∈ V in the graph. The problem of computing the global number of triangles in a graph has been considered before, but to our knowledge this is the first paper that addresses the problem of local triangle counting with a focus on the efficiency issues arising in massive graphs. The distribution of the local number of triangles and the related local clustering coefficient can be used in many interesting applications. For example, we show that the measures we compute can help to detect the presence of spamming activity in large-scale Web graphs, as well as to provide useful features to assess content quality in social networks. For computing the local number of triangles we propose two approximation algorithms, which are based on the idea of min-wise independent permutations (Broder et al. 1998). Our algorithms operate in a semi-streaming fashion, using O(jV j) space in main memory and performing O(log jV j) sequential scans over the edges of the graph. The first algorithm we describe in this paper also uses O(jEj) space in external memory during computation, while the second algorithm uses only main memory. We present the theoretical analysis as well as experimental results in massive graphs demonstrating the practical efficiency of our approach.},

While complex machine-learning algorithms and advanced electronic hardware (henceforth referred to as 'hardware') that can support large-scale learning have been realized in recent years and support applications such as speech recognition and computer vision, emerging computing challenges require real-time learning, prediction, and automated decision-making in diverse domains such as autonomous vehicles, military applications, healthcare informatics and business analytics. A salient feature of these emerging domains is the large and continuously streaming data sets that these applications generate, which must be processed efficiently enough to support real-time learning and decision making based on these data. This challenge requires novel hardware techniques and machine-learning architectures. This solicitation seeks to lay the foundation for next-generation co-design of RTML algorithms and hardware, with the principal focus on developing novel hardware architectures and learning algorithms in which all stages of training (including incremental training, hyperparameter estimation, and deployment) can be performed in real time. The National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) are teaming up through this Real-Time Machine Learning (RTML) program to explore high-performance, energy-efficient hardware and machine-learning architectures that can learn from a continuous stream of new data in real time, through opportunities for post-award collaboration between researchers supported by DARPA and NSF.},

abstract = {Submodular maximization is a general optimization problem with a wide range of applications in machine learning (e.g., active learning, clustering, and feature selection). In large-scale optimization, the parallel running time of an algorithm is governed by its adaptivity, which measures the number of sequential rounds needed if the algorithm can execute polynomially-many independent oracle queries in parallel. While low adaptivity is ideal, it is not sufficient for an algorithm to be efficient in practice—there are many applications of distributed submodular optimization where the number of function evaluations becomes prohibitively expensive. Motivated by these applications, we study the adaptivity and query complexity of submodular maximization. In this paper, we give the first constant-factor approximation algorithm for maximizing a nonmonotone submodular function subject to a cardinality constraint A; that runs in 0(log(n)) adaptive rounds and makes 0(n log(fc)) oracle queries in expectation. In our empirical study, we use three real-world applications to compare our algorithm with several benchmarks for non-monotone submodular maximization. The results demonstrate that our algorithm finds competitive solutions using significantly fewer rounds and queries.},

In this paper, we study the problem of maximizing a monotone submodular function in the streaming setting with a cardinality constraint $k$. We first propose Sieve-Streaming++, which requires just one pass over the data, keeps only $O(k)$ elements and achieves the tight $(1/2)$-approximation guarantee. The best previously known streaming algorithms either achieve a suboptimal $(1/4)$-approximation with $\Theta(k)$ memory or the optimal $(1/2)$-approximation with $O(k\log k)$ memory. Next, we show that by buffering a small fraction of the stream and applying a careful filtering procedure, one can heavily reduce the number of adaptive computational rounds, thus substantially lowering the computational complexity of Sieve-Streaming++. We then generalize our results to the more challenging multi-source streaming setting. We show how one can achieve the tight $(1/2)$-approximation guarantee with $O(k)$ shared memory while minimizing not only the required rounds of computations but also the total number of communicated bits. Finally, we demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithms on real-world data summarization tasks for multi-source streams of tweets and of YouTube videos.},

We design a Theory of Mind neural network -- a ToMnet -- which uses meta-learning to build models of the agents it encounters, from observations of their behaviour alone. Through this process, it acquires a strong prior model for agents' behaviour, as well as the ability to bootstrap to richer predictions about agents' characteristics and mental states using only a small number of behavioural observations. We apply the ToMnet to agents behaving in simple gridworld environments, showing that it learns to model random, algorithmic, and deep reinforcement learning agents from varied populations, and that it passes classic ToM tasks such as the "Sally-Anne" test (Wimmer & Perner, 1983; Baron-Cohen et al., 1985) of recognising that others can hold false beliefs about the world. We argue that this system -- which autonomously learns how to model other agents in its world -- is an important step forward for developing multi-agent AI systems, for building intermediating technology for machine-human interaction, and for advancing the progress on interpretable AI.},

However, the D2D transmission as an underlay causes severe interference to both the cellular and other D2D links, which imposes a great technical challenge to radio resource allocation. Conventional graph based resource allocation methods typically consider the interference between two user equipments (UEs), but they cannot model the interference from multiple UEs to completely characterize the interference. In this paper, we study channel allocation using hypergraph theory to coordinate the interference between D2D pairs and cellular UEs, where an arbitrary number of D2D pairs are allowed to share the uplink channels with the cellular UEs. Hypergraph coloring is used to model the cumulative interference from multiple D2D pairs, and thus, eliminate the mutual interference. Simulation results show that the system capacity is significantly improved using the proposed hypergraph method in comparison to the conventional graph based one.},

Since then, many details of the described vision have become reality: Our mobile phones are powerful multimedia systems, our cars computer systems on wheels, and our homes are turning into smart living environments. All these advances must be turned into products for very cost-sensitive world markets in shorter cycles than ever before. Today, the resulting requirements for design, setup, and operation of our factories become crucial for success. In the past, we often increased the complexity in structures and control systems, resulting in inflexible monolithic production systems. But the future must become "lean"-not only in organization, but also in planning and technology!Wemust develop technologies which allow us to speed up planning and setup, to adapt to rapid product changes during operation, and to reduce the planning effort. To meet these challenges we should also make use of the smart technologies of our daily lives. But for industrial use, there are many open questions to be answered. The existing technologies may be acceptable for consumer use but not yet for industrial applications with high safety and security requirements. Therefore, the SmartFactoryKL initiative was founded by industrial and academic partners to create and operate a demonstration and research test bed for future factory technologies.

abstract = {Neural architecture search (NAS) is gaining more and more attention in recent years due to its flexibility and the remarkable capability of reducing the burden of neural network design. To achieve better performance, however, the searching process usually costs massive computation, which might not be affordable to researchers and practitioners. While recent attempts have employed ensemble learning methods to mitigate the enormous computation, an essential characteristic of diversity in ensemble methods is missed out, causing more similar sub-architectures to be gathered and potential redundancy in the final ensemble architecture. To bridge this gap, we propose a pruning method for NAS ensembles, named as ''Sub-Architecture Ensemble Pruning in Neural Architecture Search (SAEP).'' It targets to utilize diversity and achieve sub-ensemble architectures in a smaller size with comparable performance to the unpruned ensemble architectures. Three possible solutions are proposed to decide which subarchitectures should be pruned during the searching process. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in largely reducing the size of ensemble architectures while maintaining the final performance. Moreover, distinct deeper architectures could be discovered if the searched sub-architectures are not diverse enough.},

Clustering 16S rRNA gene sequences into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) is a common method used in studying microbial communities. We present a new approach to greedy clustering using a trie-like data structure and Four Russians speedup. We evaluate the running time of our method in terms of the number of comparisons it makes during clustering and show in experimental results that the number of comparisons grows linearly with the size of the dataset as opposed to the quadratic running time of other methods. We compare the clusters output by our method to the popular greedy clustering tool UCLUST. We show that the clusters we generate can be both tighter and larger. 1998 ACM Subject Classification B.2.4 Algorithms The problem of comparing a string against a large set of sequences is of central importance in domains such as computational biology, information retrieval, and databases. Solving this problem is a key subroutine in many greedy clustering heuristics, wherein we iteratively choose a cluster center and form a cluster by recruiting all strings which are similar to the center. In computational biology, sequence similarity search is used to group biological sequences that are closely related. We will use this domain as a motivating example throughout the paper. Traditionally, clustering 16S rRNA gene [11] sequences involved building a multiple sequence alignment of all sequences, computing a pairwise distance matrix of sequences based on the multiple sequence alignment, and clustering this matrix [17]. However, finding the best multiple sequence alignment is computationally intractable and belongs to the class of *},

abstract = {In the Stochastic Orienteering problem, we are given a metric, where each node also has a job located there with some deterministic reward and a random size. (Think of the jobs as being chores one needs to run, and the sizes as the amount of time it takes to do the chore.) The goal is to adaptively decide which nodes to visit to maximize total expected reward, subject to the constraint that the total distance traveled plus the total size of jobs processed is at most a given budget of B. (I.e., we get reward for all those chores we finish by the end of the day). The (random) size of a job is not known until it is completely processed. Hence the problem combines aspects of both the stochastic knapsack problem with uncertain item sizes and the deterministic orienteering problem of using a limited travel time to maximize gathered rewards located at nodes. In this paper, we present a constant-factor approximation algorithm for the best non-adaptive policy for the Stochastic Orienteering problem. We also show a small adaptivity gap---i.e., the existence of a non-adaptive policy whose reward is at least an $\Omega$(1/log log B) fraction of the optimal expected reward---and hence we also get an O(log log B)-approximation algorithm for the adaptive problem. Finally we address the case when the node rewards are also random and could be correlated with the waiting time, and give a non-adaptive policy which is an O(log n {logB})-approximation to the best adaptive policy on n-node metrics with budget B.},

abstract = {The original simplicial method (OSM), a variant of the classic Kelley's cutting plane method, has been shown to converge to the minimizer of a composite convex and submodular objective, though no rate of convergence for this method was known. Moreover, OSM is required to solve subproblems in each iteration whose size grows linearly in the number of iterations. We propose a limited memory version of Kelley's method (L-KM) and os OSM that requires limited memory (at most n + 1 constraints for an n-dimensional problem) independent of the iteration. We prove convergence for L-KM when the convex part of the objective (g) is strongly convex and show it converges linearly when g is also smooth. Our analysis relies on duality between minimization of the composite objective and minimization of a convex function over the corresponding submodular base polytope. We introduce a limited memory version, L-FCFW, of the Fully-Corrective Frank-Wolfe (FCFW) method with approximate correction, to solve the dual problem. We show that L-FCFW and L-KM are dual algorithms that produce the same sequence of iterates; hence both converge linearly (when g is smooth and strongly convex) and with limited memory. We propose L-KM to minimize composite convex and submodular objectives; however, our results on L-FCFW hold for general polytopes and may be of independent interest.},

The construction of such systems involves many distributed design choices. The end products (e.g., rec-ommendation systems, medical analysis tools, real-time game engines, speech recognizers) thus involves many tunable config-uration parameters. These parameters are often specified and hard-coded into the software by various developers or teams. If optimized jointly, these parameters can result in significant improvements. Bayesian optimization is a powerful tool for the joint optimization of design choices that is gaining great popularity in recent years. It promises greater automation so as to increase both product quality and human productivity. This review paper introduces Bayesian optimization, highlights some of its methodological aspects, and showcases a wide range of applications.},

Allocation systems attempt to reuse such deallocated regions in order to minimize the footprint on disk. If previously allocated blocks cannot be moved, the problem is called the memory allocation problem, which is known to have a logarithmic overhead in the footprint. This paper defines the storage reallocation problem, where previously allocated blocks can be moved, or reallocated, but at some cost. The algorithms presented here are cost oblivious, in that they work for a broad and reasonable class of cost functions, even when they do not know what the cost function is. The objective is to minimize the storage footprint, that is, the largest memory address containing an allocated object, while simultaneously minimizing the reallocation costs. This paper gives asymptotically optimal algorithms for storage reallocation, in which the storage footprint is at most (1+epsilon) times optimal, and the reallocation cost is at most (1/epsilon) times the original allocation cost, which is also optimal. The algorithms are cost oblivious as long as the allocation/reallocation cost function is subadditive.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} Copyright 2016, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org). All rights reserved. In multi-label learning, there are two main challenges: missing labels and class imbalance (CIB). The former assumes that only a partial set of labels are provided for each training instance while other labels are missing. CIB is observed from two perspectives: first, the number of negative labels of each instance is much larger than its positive labels; second, the rate of positive instances (i.e. the number of positive instances divided by the total number of instances) of different classes are significantly different. Both missing labels and CIB lead to significant performance degradation. In this work, we propose a new method to handle these two challenges simultaneously. We formulate the problem as a constrained submodular minimization that is composed of a submodular objective function that encourages label consistency and smoothness, as well as, class cardinality bound constraints to handle class imbalance. We further present a convex approximation based on the Lovasz extension of submodular functions, leading to a linear program, which can be efficiently solved by the alternative direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the improved performance of our method over several state-of-the-art methods.},

Traditionally, demand response has been focused on large industrial and commercial loads, however it is expected that a large number of small residential loads such as air conditioners, dish washers, and electric vehicles will also participate in the coming years. The electricity consumption of these smaller loads, which we call deferrable loads, can be shifted over time, and thus be used (in aggregate) to compensate for the random fluctuations in renewable generation. In this paper, we propose a real-time distributed deferrable load control algorithm to reduce the variance of aggregate load (load minus renewable generation) by shifting the power consumption of deferrable loads to periods with high renewable generation. At every time step, the algorithm minimizes the expected variance to go with updated predictions. We prove that suboptimality of the algorithm vanishes as time horizon expands. Further, we evaluate the algorithm via trace-based simulations.},

With the strongly increased interest in machine learning in general, it has, as a result, become difficult to keep track of what represents the state-of-the-art at the moment, e.g., for top-n recommendation tasks. At the same time, several recent publications point out problems in today's research practice in applied machine learning, e.g., in terms of the reproducibility of the results or the choice of the baselines when proposing new models. In this work, we report the results of a systematic analysis of algorithmic proposals for top-n recommendation tasks. Specifically, we considered 18 algorithms that were presented at top-level research conferences in the last years. Only 7 of them could be reproduced with reasonable effort. For these methods, it however turned out that 6 of them can often be outperformed with comparably simple heuristic methods, e.g., based on nearest-neighbor or graph-based techniques. The remaining one clearly outperformed the baselines but did not consistently outperform a well-tuned non-neural linear ranking method. Overall, our work sheds light on a number of potential problems in today's machine learning scholarship and calls for improved scientific practices in this area.

abstract = {Our dependence on networks – be they infrastructure, economic, social or others – leaves us prone to crises caused by the vulnerabilities of these networks. There is a great need to develop new methods to protect infrastructure networks and prevent cascade of failures (especially in cases of coupled networks). Terrorist attacks on transportation networks have traumatized modern societies. With a single blast, it has become possible to paralyze airline traffic, electric power supply, ground transportation or Internet communication. How, and at which cost can one restructure the network such that it will become more robust against malicious attacks? The gradual increase in attacks on the networks society depends on – Internet, mobile phone, transportation, air travel, banking, etc. – emphasize the need to develop new strategies to protect and defend these crucial networks of communication and infrastructure networks. One example is the threat of liquid explosives a few years ago, which completely shut down air travel for days, and has created extreme changes in regulations. Such threats and dangers warrant the need for new tools and strategies to defend critical infrastructure. In this paper we review recent advances in the theoretical understanding of the vulnerabilities of interdependent networks with and without spatial embedding, attack strategies and their affect on such networks of networks as well as recently developed strategies to optimize and repair failures caused by such attacks.},

In this work, we develop a new framework to solve any combinatorial optimization problem over graphs that can be formulated as a single player game defined by states, actions, and rewards, including minimum spanning tree, shortest paths, traveling salesman problem, and vehicle routing problem, without expert knowledge. Our method trains a graph neural network using reinforcement learning on an unlabeled training set of graphs. The trained network then outputs approximate solutions to new graph instances in linear running time. In contrast, previous approximation algorithms or heuristics tailored to NP-hard problems on graphs generally have at least quadratic running time. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach on both polynomial and NP-hard problems with optimality gaps close to 1, and show that our method is able to generalize well: (i) from training on small graphs to testing on large graphs; (ii) from training on random graphs of one type to testing on random graphs of another type; and (iii) from training on random graphs to running on real world graphs.},

These problems occur naturally in several real-world applications in data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. The problems are ordinarily inapproximable to any factor (as we show). Using the curvature $\kappa_f$ of the submodular term, and introducing $\kappa^g$ for the supermodular term (a natural dual curvature for supermodular functions), however, both of which are computable in linear time, we show that BP maximization can be efficiently approximated by both the greedy and the semi-gradient based algorithm. The algorithms yield multiplicative guarantees of $\frac{1}{\kappa_f}\left[1-e^{-(1-\kappa^g)\kappa_f}\right]$ and $\frac{1-\kappa^g}{(1-\kappa^g)\kappa_f + p}$ for the two types of constraints respectively. For pure monotone supermodular constrained maximization, these yield $1-\kappa^g$ and $(1-\kappa^g)/p$ for the two types of constraints respectively. We also analyze the hardness of BP maximization and show that our guarantees match hardness by a constant factor and by $O(\ln(p))$ respectively. Computational experiments are also provided supporting our analysis.},

abstract = {Social networks are commonly used for marketing purposes. For example, free samples of a product can be given to a few influential social network users (or "seed nodes"), with the hope that they will convince their friends to buy it. One way to formalize marketers' objective is through influence maximization (or IM), whose goal is to find the best seed nodes to activate under a fixed budget, so that the number of people who get influenced in the end is maximized. Recent solutions to IM rely on the influence probability that a user influences another one. However, this probability information may be unavailable or incomplete. In this paper, we study IM in the absence of complete information on influence probability. We call this problem Online Influence Maximization (OIM) since we learn influence probabilities at the same time we run influence campaigns. To solve OIM, we propose a multiple-trial approach, where (1) some seed nodes are selected based on existing influence information; (2) an influence campaign is started with these seed nodes; and (3) users' feedback is used to update influence information. We adopt the Explore-Exploit strategy, which can select seed nodes using either the current influence probability estimation (exploit), or the confidence bound on the estimation (explore). Any existing IM algorithm can be used in this framework. We also develop an incremental algorithm that can significantly reduce the overhead of handling users' feedback information. Our experiments show that our solution is more effective than traditional IM methods on the partial information.},

abstract = {Creating impact in real-world settings requires artificial intelligence techniques to span the full pipeline from data, to predictive models, to decisions. These components are typically approached separately: a machine learning model is first trained via a measure of predictive accuracy, and then its predictions are used as input into an optimization algorithm which produces a decision. However, the loss function used to train the model may easily be misaligned with the end goal, which is to make the best decisions possible. Hand-tuning the loss function to align with optimization is a difficult and error-prone process (which is often skipped entirely).We focus on combinatorial optimization problems and introduce a general framework for decision-focused learning, where the machine learning model is directly trained in conjunction with the optimization algorithm to produce highquality decisions. Technically, our contribution is a means of integrating common classes of discrete optimization problems into deep learning or other predictive models, which are typically trained via gradient descent. The main idea is to use a continuous relaxation of the discrete problem to propagate gradients through the optimization procedure. We instantiate this framework for two broad classes of combinatorial problems: linear programs and submodular maximization. Experimental results across a variety of domains show that decisionfocused learning often leads to improved optimization performance compared to traditional methods. We find that standard measures of accuracy are not a reliable proxy for a predictive model's utility in optimization, and our method's ability to specify the true goal as the model's training objective yields substantial dividends across a range of decision problems.},

The data track Twitter activity around the protests that took place in May 2011, which led to the formation of camp sites in dozens of cities all over the country and massive daily demonstrations during the week prior to the elections of May 22. We reconstruct the network of tens of thousands of users and monitor their message activity for a month (April 25, 2011, to May 25, 2011). Using both the structure of the network and levels of activity in message exchange, we identify four types of users and analyze their role in the growth of the protest. Drawing from theories of online activism and research on information diffusion in networks, this article centers on the following two questions: How does protest information spread in online networks? And how do different actors contribute to the growth of activity? The article aims to inform the theoretical debate on whether digital technologies are changing the logic of collective action and to provide evidence of how new media facilitates the emergence of massive offline mobilizations.},

This problem is relevant for social tasks (objective analysis of relationships on the web), biological inquiries (functional studies in metabolic and protein networks), or technological problems (optimization of large infrastructures). Several types of algorithms exist for revealing the community structure in networks, but a general and quantitative definition of community is not implemented in the algorithms, leading to an intrinsic difficulty in the interpretation of the results without any additional nontopological information. In this article we deal with this problem by showing how quantitative definitions of community are implemented in practice in the existing algorithms. In this way the algorithms for the identification of the community structure become fully self-contained. Furthermore, we propose a local algorithm to detect communities which outperforms the existing algorithms with respect to computational cost, keeping the same level of reliability. The algorithm is tested on artificial and real-world graphs. In particular, we show how the algorithm applies to a network of scientific collaborations, which, for its size, cannot be attacked with the usual methods. This type of local algorithm could open the way to applications to large-scale technological and biological systems.},

Previously, the best known algorithm for this problem was a $5.828$-approximation semi-streaming algorithm based on a local search technique (Feldman et al., 2018). For the special case of this problem in which the objective function is also monotone, the state-of-the-art semi-streaming algorithm is an algorithm known as Sieve-Streaming, which is based on a different technique (Badanidiyuru, 2014). Adapting the technique of Sieve-Streaming to non-monotone objective functions has turned out to be a challenging task, which has so far prevented an improvement over the local search based $5.828$-approximation. In this work, we overcome the above challenge, and manage to adapt Sieve-Streaming to non-monotone objective functions by introducing a "just right" amount of randomness into it. Consequently, we get a semi-streaming polynomial time $4.282$-approximation algorithm for non-monotone objectives. Moreover, if one allows our algorithm to run in super-polynomial time, then its approximation ratio can be further improved to $3 + \varepsilon$.},

abstract = {Recent research on social contagion has demonstrated significant ef-fects of network topology on the dynamics of diffusion. However, net-work topologies are not given a priori. Rather, they are patterns of re-lations that emerge from individual and structural features of society, such as population composition, group heterogeneity, homophily, and social consolidation. Following Blau and Schwartz, the author devel-ops a model of social network formation that explores how social and structural constraints on tie formation generate emergent social topol-ogies and then explores the effectiveness of these social networks for the dynamics of social diffusion. Results show that, at one extreme, high levels of consolidation can create highly balkanized communities with poor integration of shared norms and practices. As suggested by Blau and Schwartz, reducing consolidation creates more crosscut-ting circles and significantly improves the dynamics of social diffusion across the population. However, the author finds that further reduc-ing consolidation creates highly intersecting social networks that fail to support the widespread diffusion of norms and practices, indicating that successful social diffusion can depend on moderate to high levels of structural consolidation. Recent theoretical and empirical studies on the spread of social norms have identified the importance of network topology—the large-scale pattern of ties within a population—for determining both the rate and extent of dif-fusion processes ðWatts and This content downloaded from 165.123.34.86 on Mon, 1 Jun 2015 01:08:35 AM All use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions man, Barabasi, and Watts 2006; Centola and Macy 2007; Centola 2010Þ. While much of the literature on networks treats the topological features of social structure as given quantities, networks do not emerge ex nihilo, but are endogenously formed patterns of relationships that are created by individual and institutional forces that constrain and direct everyday in-teractions ðBlau 1977; McPherson and Smith-Lovin 1987; McPherson, Po-pielarz, and Drobnic 1992; Popielarz and McPherson 1995; Watts, Dodds, and Newman 2002; Kossinets and Watts 2009Þ. For instance, at the indi-vidual level, choice homophily—people's preference to form social con-nections with others who are like themselves—is a powerful force that controls the formation of social ties ðVerbrugge 1977; Blau and Schwartz 1984; Shrum, Cheek, and Hunter 1988; McPherson, Smith-Lovin, and Cook 2001; Reagans 2005; Currarini, Jackson, and Pin 2010; Centola and van de Rijt 2015Þ. At the level of social structure, organizational and in-stitutional contexts form the basis for social interaction ðBlau 1977; Mc-Pherson et al. 1992; McPherson 2004Þ, and the distribution and consolida-tion of characteristics across a population determine the frequency with which people with diverse characteristics come in contact with one another ðBlau 1977; Blau and Schwartz 1984; McPherson et al. 1992Þ. Together, these forces help to shape the collective pattern of network ties that emerges within a society. These individual and institutional forces can thereby indirectly affect the potential for social integration. Classic work by Blau and Schwartz ð1984Þ on the relationship between social institutions and emergent network struc-tures found that " consolidated " societies—where one's friends, colleagues, and neighbors are all the same people—limit social integration across the society by preventing the formation of " cross-cutting social ties " between diverse social groups. I take Blau and Schwartz's structural theory one step further by investigating social integration as a diffusion process—in particular, the spread of shared cultural practices and social norms throughout a popu-lation ðBoyd and Richerson 1985; Castro and Toro 2004; Centola and Macy 2007Þ. The central goal of this article is to explore how changes in a society's population structure affect these forms of social diffusion. I proceed by first investigating how the " primitive " structural parame-ters of homophily and consolidation ðSkvoretz 1983; Blau and Schwartz 1984Þ control the formation of social networks with distinct topological properties—such as clustering, path length, and bridge width. I then explore the effectiveness of these emergent networks for promoting the spread of},

Fully polynomial time approximation schemes (FPTAS) for the case of K=2 have been reported in the literature. We concentrate on the general case and make the following contributions. 1) We present a very simple (Km+nlogn) time K-approximation algorithm that can be used in hop-by-hop routing protocols. 2) We present an FPTAS for one optimization version of the QoS routing problem with a time complexity of O(m(n/epsi)<sup>K-1</sup>). 3) We present an FPTAS for another optimization version of the QoS routing problem with a time complexity of O(nlogn+m(H/epsi)<sup>K-1</sup>) when there exists an H-hop path satisfying all QoS constraints. When K is reduced to 2, our results compare favorably with existing algorithms. The results of this paper hold for both directed and undirected graphs.

abstract = {We address the problem of maximizing an unknown submodular function that can only be accessed via noisy evaluations. Our work is motivated by the task of summarizing content, e.g., image collections, by leveraging users' feedback in form of clicks or ratings. For summarization tasks with the goal of maximizing coverage and diversity, submodular set functions are a natural choice. When the underlying submodular function is unknown, users' feedback can provide noisy evaluations of the function that we seek to maximize. We provide a generic algorithm -- \submM{} -- for maximizing an unknown submodular function under cardinality constraints. This algorithm makes use of a novel exploration module -- \blbox{} -- that proposes good elements based on adaptively sampling noisy function evaluations. \blbox{} is able to accommodate different kinds of observation models such as value queries and pairwise comparisons. We provide PAC-style guarantees on the quality and sampling cost of the solution obtained by \submM{}. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in an interactive, crowdsourced image collection summarization application.},

This paper focuses on indirect interdependencies between cyber and power networks. Certain applications of indirect interdependencies in modern power systems are discussed, and a state updating-based model is proposed to quantitatively evaluate the reliability of cyber-power networks under indirect interdependencies. Two optimization models are used to maximize the data connectivity in the cyber network and minimize the load curtailment in the power network.

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Next-generation sequencing allows us to sequence reads from a microbial environment using single-cell sequencing or metagenomic sequencing technologies. However, both technologies suffer from the problem that sequencing depth of different regions of a genome or genomes from different species are highly uneven. Most existing genome assemblers usually have an assumption that sequencing depths are even. These assemblers fail to construct correct long contigs.\n\nRESULTS: We introduce the IDBA-UD algorithm that is based on the de Bruijn graph approach for assembling reads from single-cell sequencing or metagenomic sequencing technologies with uneven sequencing depths. Several non-trivial techniques have been employed to tackle the problems. Instead of using a simple threshold, we use multiple depthrelative thresholds to remove erroneous k-mers in both low-depth and high-depth regions. The technique of local assembly with paired-end information is used to solve the branch problem of low-depth short repeat regions. To speed up the process, an error correction step is conducted to correct reads of high-depth regions that can be aligned to highconfident contigs. Comparison of the performances of IDBA-UD and existing assemblers (Velvet, Velvet-SC, SOAPdenovo and Meta-IDBA) for different datasets, shows that IDBA-UD can reconstruct longer contigs with higher accuracy.\n\nAVAILABILITY: The IDBA-UD toolkit is available at our website http://www.cs.hku.hk/$\sim$alse/idba_ud},

Here, we measured activity patterns obtained from multisite local field potential recordings in cortex cultures, urethane-anesthetized rats, and awake macaque monkeys. First, we quantified the information capacity of the pattern repertoire of ongoing and stimulus-evoked activity using Shannon entropy. Next, we quantified the efficacy of information transmission between stimulus and response using mutual information. By systematically changing the ratio of excitation/inhibition (E/I) in vitro and in a network model, we discovered that both information capacity and information transmission are maximized at a particular intermediate E/I, at which ongoing activity emerges as neuronal avalanches. Next, we used our in vitro and model results to correctly predict in vivo information capacity and interactions between neuronal groups during ongoing activity. Close agreement between our experiments and model suggest that neuronal avalanches and peak information capacity arise because of criticality and are general properties of cortical networks with balanced E/I.},

abstract = {A key ingredient in social contagion dynamics is reinforcement, as adopting a certain social behavior requires verification of its credibility and legitimacy. Memory of nonredundant information plays an important role in reinforcement, which so far has eluded theoretical analysis. We first propose a general social contagion model with reinforcement derived from nonredundant information memory. Then, we develop a unified edge-based compartmental theory to analyze this model, and a remarkable agreement with numerics is obtained on some specific models. We use a spreading threshold model as a specific example to understand the memory effect, in which each individual adopts a social behavior only when the cumulative pieces of information that the individual received from his or her neighbors exceeds an adoption threshold. Through analysis and numerical simulations, we find that the memory characteristic markedly affects the dynamics as quantified by the final adoption size. Strikingly, we uncover a transition phenomenon in which the dependence of the final adoption size on some key parameters, such as the transmission probability, can change from being discontinuous to being continuous. The transition can be triggered by proper parameters and structural perturbations to the system, such as decreasing individuals' adoption threshold, increasing initial seed size, or enhancing the network heterogeneity.},

abstract = {We study the online submodular maximization problem with free disposal under a matroid constraint. Elements from some ground set arrive one by one in rounds, and the algorithm maintains a feasible set that is independent in the underlying matroid. In each round when a new element arrives, the algorithm may accept the new element into its feasible set and possibly remove elements from it, provided that the resulting set is still independent. The goal is to maximize the value of the final feasible set under some monotone submodular function, to which the algorithm has oracle access. For k-uniform matroids, we give a deterministic algorithm with competitive ratio at least 0:2959, and the ratio approaches as k approaches infinity, improving the previous best ratio of 0:25 by Chakrabarti and Kale (IPCO 2014), Buchbinder et al. (SODA 2015) and Chekuri et al. (ICALP 2015). We also show that our algorithm is optimal among a class of deterministic monotone algorithms that accept a new arriving element only if the objective is strictly increased. Further, we prove that no deterministic monotone algorithm can be strictly better than 0:25-competitive even for partition matroids, the most modest generalization of k-uniform matroids, matching the competitive ratio by Chakrabarti and Kale (IPCO 2014) and Chekuri et al. (ICALP 2015). Interestingly, we show that randomized algorithms are strictly more powerful by giving a (non-monotone) randomized algorithm for partition matroids with ratio 1 Finally, our techniques can be extended to a more general problem that generalizes both the online submodular maximization problem and the online bipartite matching problem with free disposal. Using the techniques developed in this paper, we give constant-competitive algorithms for the submodular online bipartite matching problem.},

While efficient streaming methods have been recently developed for monotone submodular maximization, in a wide range of applications, such as video summarization, the underlying utility function is non-monotone, and there are often various constraints imposed on the optimization problem to consider privacy or personalization. We develop the first efficient single pass streaming algorithm, Streaming Local Search, that for any streaming monotone submodular maximization algorithm with approximation guarantee $\alpha$ under a collection of independence systems ${\cal I}$, provides a constant $1/\big(1+2/\sqrt{\alpha}+1/\alpha +2d(1+\sqrt{\alpha})\big)$ approximation guarantee for maximizing a non-monotone submodular function under the intersection of ${\cal I}$ and $d$ knapsack constraints.

abstract = {The alternating gradient descent (AGD) is a simple but popular algorithm which has been applied to problems in optimization, machine learning, data ming, and signal processing, etc. The algorithm updates two blocks of variables in an alternating manner, in which a gradient step is taken on one block, while keeping the remaining block fixed. When the objective function is nonconvex, it is well-known the AGD converges to the first-order stationary solution with a global sublinear rate. In this paper, we show that a variant of AGD-type algorithms will not be trapped by "bad" stationary solutions such as saddle points and local maximum points. In particular, we consider a smooth unconstrained optimization problem, and propose a perturbed AGD (PA-GD) which converges (with high probability) to the set of second-order stationary solutions (SS2) with a global sublinear rate. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first alternating type algorithm which takes $\mathcal{O}(\text{polylog}(d)/\epsilon^{7/3})$ iterations to achieve SS2 with high probability [where polylog$(d)$ is polynomial of the logarithm of dimension $d$ of the problem].},

False infor-mation can originate from a number of sources including rumors, literary fiction, mainstream media, corporate-vested interests, governments, and nongovernmental organizations. The rise of the Internet and user-driven content has provided a venue for quick and broad dissemination of information, not all of which is accurate. Con-sequently, a large body of research spanning a number of disciplines has sought to understand misinformation and determine which interventions are most effective in reducing its influence. This essay summarizes research into misinformation, bringing together studies from psychology, political science, education, and computer science. Cognitive psychology investigates why individuals struggle with correcting misinformation and inaccurate beliefs, and why myths are so difficult to dislodge. Two important findings involve (i) various " backfire effects, " which arise when refutations ironically reinforce misconceptions, and (ii) the role of worldviews in accentuating the persistence of misinformation. Computer scientists simulate the spread of misinformation through social networks and develop algorithms to automatically detect or neutralize myths. We draw together various research threads to provide guidelines on how to effectively refute misconceptions without risking backfire effects.},

We then propose to incorporate a noise-aware strategy into POSS, resulting in the new PONSS algorithm.

Taking inspiration from the network properties of biological neural networks (e.g. sparsity, scale-freeness), we argue that (contrary to general practice) artificial neural networks, too, should not have fully-connected layers. Here we propose sparse evolutionary training of artificial neural networks, an algorithm which evolves an initial sparse topology (Erdos-R{\'{e}}nyi random graph) of two consecutive layers of neurons into a scale-free topology, during learning. Our method replaces artificial neural networks fully-connected layers with sparse ones before training, reducing quadratically the number of parameters, with no decrease in accuracy. We demonstrate our claims on restricted Boltzmann machines, multi-layer perceptrons, and convolutional neural networks for unsupervised and supervised learning on 15 datasets.

abstract = {Device-to-device (D2D) communications has recently emerged as a promising technology for boosting the capacity of cellular systems. D2D enables direct communication between mobile devices over the cellular band without utilizing infrastructure nodes such as base stations, thereby reducing the load on cellular base stations and increasing network throughput through spatial reuse of radio resources. Hence it is important to optimally allocate these radio resources. Furthermore, since the composition of a cellular macro cell is highly dynamic, it is critical to adaptively update the resource allocation for D2D communications rather than recomputing it from scratch. In this work, we develop the first online algorithm, namely ODSRA, for dynamic resource allocation while maximizing spatial reuse. At the core of the resource allocation problem is the online set multicover problem, for which we present the first deterministic O (log n log m)-competitive online algorithm, where n is the number of elements, and m the number of sets. By simulation, we show the efficacy of ODSRA by analyzing network throughput and other metrics, obtaining a large improvement in running time over offline methods.},

abstract = {How well does a classic deep net architecture like AlexNet or VGG19 classify on a standard dataset such as CIFAR-10 when its "width" --- namely, number of channels in convolutional layers, and number of nodes in fully-connected internal layers --- is allowed to increase to infinity? Such questions have come to the forefront in the quest to theoretically understand deep learning and its mysteries about optimization and generalization. They also connect deep learning to notions such as Gaussian processes and kernels. A recent paper [Jacot et al., 2018] introduced the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) which captures the behavior of fully-connected deep nets in the infinite width limit trained by gradient descent; this object was implicit in some other recent papers. A subsequent paper [Lee et al., 2019] gave heuristic Monte Carlo methods to estimate the NTK and its extension, Convolutional Neural Tangent Kernel (CNTK) and used this to try to understand the limiting behavior on datasets like CIFAR-10. The current paper gives the first efficient exact algorithm (based upon dynamic programming) for computing CNTK as well as an efficient GPU implementation of this algorithm. This results in a significant new benchmark for performance of a pure kernel-based method on CIFAR-10, being 10% higher than the methods reported in [Novak et al., 2019], and only 5% lower than the performance of the corresponding finite deep net architecture (once batch normalization etc. are turned off). We give the first non-asymptotic proof showing that a fully-trained sufficiently wide net is indeed equivalent to the kernel regression predictor using NTK. Our experiments also demonstrate that earlier Monte Carlo approximation can degrade the performance significantly, thus highlighting the power of our exact kernel computation, which we have applied even to the full CIFAR-10 dataset and 20-layer nets.},

abstract = {This paper surveys the recent attempts, both from the machine learning and operations research communities, at leveraging machine learning to solve combinatorial optimization problems. Given the hard nature of these problems, state-of-the-art algorithms rely on handcrafted heuristics for making decisions that are otherwise too expensive to compute or mathematically not well defined. Thus, machine learning looks like a natural candidate to make such decisions in a more principled and optimized way. We advocate for pushing further the integration of machine learning and combinatorial optimization and detail a methodology to do so. A main point of the paper is seeing generic optimization problems as data points and inquiring what is the relevant distribution of problems to use for learning on a given task.},

Clustering coefficient was introduced more recently as a structural feature characterizing small-world networks. Noting that cohesive subgroups tend to have high clustering coefficients, this paper introduces a new clique relaxation, $\alpha$-cluster, defined by enforcing a lower bound $\alpha$ on the clustering coefficient in the corresponding induced subgraph. Two variations of the clustering coefficient are considered, namely, the local and global clustering coefficient. Certain structural properties of $\alpha$-clusters are analyzed and mathematical optimization models for determining $\alpha$-clusters of the largest size in a network are developed and validated using several real-life social networks. In addition, a network clustering algorithm based on local $\alpha$-clusters is proposed and successfully tested.},

An individual's decision whether to adopt a product or innovation will be highly dependent on the choices made by the individual's peers or neighbors in the social network. In this work, we study the game of innovation diffusion with multiple competing innovations such as when multiple companies market competing products using viral marketing. Our first contribution is a natural and mathematically tractable model for the diffusion of multiple innovations in a network. We give a (1 − 1/e) approximation algorithm for computing the best response to an opponent's strategy, and prove that the “price of competition” of this game is at most 2. We also discuss “first mover” strategies which try to maximize the expected diffusion against perfect competition. Finally, we give an FPTAS for the problem of maximizing the influence of a single player when the underlying graph is a tree.},

abstract = {Traditional online algorithms encapsulate decision making under uncertainty, and give ways to hedge against all possible future events, while guaranteeing a nearly optimal solution as compared to an offline optimum. On the other hand, machine learning algorithms are in the business of extrapolating patterns found in the data to predict the future, and usually come with strong guarantees on the expected generalization error. In this work we develop a framework for augmenting online algorithms with a machine learned oracle to achieve competitive ratios that provably improve upon unconditional worst case lower bounds when the oracle has low error. Our approach treats the oracle as a complete black box, and is not dependent on its inner workings, or the exact distribution of its errors. We apply this framework to the traditional caching problem -- creating an eviction strategy for a cache of size $k$. We demonstrate that naively following the oracle's recommendations may lead to very poor performance, even when the average error is quite low. Instead we show how to modify the Marker algorithm to take into account the oracle's predictions, and prove that this combined approach achieves a competitive ratio that both (i) decreases as the oracle's error decreases, and (ii) is always capped by $O(\log k)$, which can be achieved without any oracle input. We complement our results with an empirical evaluation of our algorithm on real world datasets, and show that it performs well empirically even using simple off-the-shelf predictions.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Research suggests that the growing prevalence of obesity may be related to the influence of the health behaviours of peers. We look at clustering of exercise and eating health behaviours amongst a previously unstudied group, young adults in Sweden. Previous research has mainly been conducted in the United States and Britain, countries that have relatively high rates of obesity. METHODS: Using ego-alter dyads from the egocentric network data as the unit of analysis, we conduct logistic regressions to investigate the association between ego and alter exercise and eating behaviours. RESULTS: Respondents have a significantly greater probability of engaging in regular exercise and eating healthily if a nominated peer also does so. Furthermore, the degree to which this behavior is shared is modulated by the strength of the relationship between the two individuals, with a greater probability of engaging in these behaviours observed when the relationship with the nominated peer is strong relative to when the relationship is weak. However, we find that ego-alter homogeneity in terms of gender and migration status was not associated with a significantly greater probability of behaving in a similar manner to a nominated peer. Furthermore, the status of the nominated peer as a relative or not did not impact the probability that the ego would engage in similar health behaviours to that alter. CONCLUSIONS: We observe strong associations between ego and alter health behaviours for young adults, consistent with previous research. Although we cannot draw causal inferences, these results suggest that the health behaviours of an individual's peers may play a role in shaping their own health behaviours.},

The text illustrates the breadth of the modeling and analysis capabilities that are supported by the software and support of complex real-world applications. Pyomo is an open source software package for formulating and solving large-scale optimization and operations research problems. The text begins with a tutorial on simple linear and integer programming models. A detailed reference of Pyomo's modeling components is illustrated with extensive examples, including a discussion of how to load data from data sources like spreadsheets and databases. Chapters describing advanced modeling capabilities for nonlinear and stochastic optimization are also included. The Pyomo software provides familiar modeling features within Python, a powerful dynamic programming language that has a very clear, readable syntax and intuitive object orientation. Pyomo includes Python classes for defining sparse sets, parameters, and variables, which can be used to formulate algebraic expressions that define objectives and constraints. Moreover, Pyomo can be used from a command-line interface and within Python's interactive command environment, which makes it easy to create Pyomo models, apply a variety of optimizers, and examine solutions. The software supports a different modeling approach than commercial AML (Algebraic Modeling Languages) tools, and is designed for flexibility, extensibility, portability, and maintainability but also maintains the central ideas in modern AMLs.},

abstract = {We consider the problem of designing a network of minimum cost while satisfying a prescribed survivability criterion. The survivability criterion requires that a feasible flow must still exists (i.e. all demands can be satisfied without violating arc capacities) even after the disruption of a subset of the network's arcs. Specifically, we consider the case in which a disruption (random or malicious) can destroy a subset of the arcs, with the cost of the disruption not to exceed a disruption budget. This problem takes the form of a tri-level, two-player game, in which the network operator designs (or augments) the network, then the attacker launches a disruption that destroys a subset of arcs, and then the network operator attempts to find a feasible flow over the residual network. We first show how this can be modeled as a two-stage stochastic program from the network operator's perspective, with each of the exponential number of potential attacks considered as a disruption scenario. We then reformulate this problem, via a Benders decomposition, to consider the recourse decisions implicitly, greatly reducing the number of variables but at the expense of an exponential increase in the number of constraints. We next develop a cut-generation based algorithm. Rather than explicitly considering each disruption scenario to identify these Benders cuts, however, we develop a bi-level program and corresponding separation algorithm that enables us to implicitly evaluate the exponential set of disruption scenarios. Our computational results demonstrate the efficacy of this approach.},

We compare our approach to state-of-the-art methods for constructing the SA sample, and demonstrate that it is the fastest and most space-efficient method on highly repetitive genomic databases.

abstract = {Distances in a network capture relations between nodes and are the basis of centrality, similarity, and influence measures. Often, however, the relevance of a node $u$ to a node $v$ is more precisely measured not by the magnitude of the distance, but by the number of nodes that are closer to $v$ than $u$. That is, by the {\em rank} of $u$ in an ordering of nodes by increasing distance from $v$. Accordingly, rank-based measures provide a semantically different alternative to distance-based measures. In contrast to single-source distances (and "forward" ranks), which can be computed in near-linear time by Dijkstra's algorithm, we show that {\em exact} reverse ranks for a single source are, in the worst-case, as hard to compute as all-pairs shortest paths, and thus can not be scalably computed even on a medium size graph. Our main contribution is the first scalable algorithm to compute {\em approximate} reverse ranks within a small relative error. Our design uses near-linear processing of the graph, after which we can perform "Dijkstra-like" single-source computations that return nodes in order of increasing approximate reverse rank. Another contribution we make that is of independent interest is a novel algorithm for computing all-distances sketches, which we use for preprocessing, on multi-core architectures. We conduct an experimental evaluation on graphs with hundreds of millions of edges, demonstrating both scalability and accuracy. Finally, we define reverse-rank influence, which naturally extends reverse nearest neighbors influence [Korn and Muthukrishnan 2000] and show how our reverse-rank single-source computation facilitates scalable greedy reverse-rank influence maximization.},

abstract = {Link prediction is a key problem for network-structured data. Link prediction heuristics use some score functions, such as common neighbors and Katz index, to measure the likelihood of links. They have obtained wide practical uses due to their simplicity, interpretability, and for some of them, scalability. However, every heuristic has a strong assumption on when two nodes are likely to link, which limits their effectiveness on networks where these assumptions fail. In this regard, a more reasonable way should be learning a suitable heuristic from a given network instead of using predefined ones. By extracting a local subgraph around each target link, we aim to learn a function mapping the subgraph patterns to link existence, thus automatically learning a `heuristic' that suits the current network. In this paper, we study this heuristic learning paradigm for link prediction. First, we develop a novel $\gamma$-decaying heuristic theory. The theory unifies a wide range of heuristics in a single framework, and proves that all these heuristics can be well approximated from local subgraphs. Our results show that local subgraphs reserve rich information related to link existence. Second, based on the $\gamma$-decaying theory, we propose a new algorithm to learn heuristics from local subgraphs using a graph neural network (GNN). Its experimental results show unprecedented performance, working consistently well on a wide range of problems.},

We then show that using error-feedback, i.e. incorporating the error made by the compression operator into the next step, overcomes these issues.

Here, the utility is assumed to exhibit submodularity, a natural diminishing returns condition preva-lent in many data summarization applications. The classical greedy algorithm is known to provide solutions with logarithmic approximation guarantees compared to the optimum solution. However, this sequential, centralized approach is imprac-tical for truly large-scale problems. In this work, we develop the first distributed algorithm – DISCOVER – for submodular set cover that is easily implementable using MapReduce-style computations. We theoretically analyze our approach, and present approximation guarantees for the solutions returned by DISCOVER. We also study a natural trade-off between the communication cost and the num-ber of rounds required to obtain such a solution. In our extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on several applications, includ-ing active set selection, exemplar based clustering, and vertex cover on tens of millions of data points using Spark.},

We show that $r\log\frac{n(\sigma-1)}{r}$ bits are necessary for any such data structure and, thus, our solution is succinct. We also describe a data structure that uses $(1 + \epsilon)r\log\frac{n\sigma}{r} + O(r)$ bits, where $\epsilon > 0$ is an arbitrary constant, with the same query times but without the restriction $r \le n / \log^{\omega(1)} n$. By simple reductions to the colored predecessor problem, we show that the query times are optimal in the important case $r \ge 2^{\log^\delta n}$, for an arbitrary constant $\delta > 0$. We implement our solution and compare it with the state of the art, showing that the closest competitors consume 31-46% more space.},

abstract = {Random Matrix Theory (RMT) is applied to analyze the weight matrices of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), including both production quality, pre-trained models such as AlexNet and Inception, and smaller models trained from scratch, such as LeNet5 and a miniature-AlexNet. Empirical and theoretical results clearly indicate that the empirical spectral density (ESD) of DNN layer matrices displays signatures of traditionally-regularized statistical models, even in the absence of exogenously specifying traditional forms of regularization, such as Dropout or Weight Norm constraints. Building on recent results in RMT, most notably its extension to Universality classes of Heavy-Tailed matrices, we develop a theory to identify \emph{5+1 Phases of Training}, corresponding to increasing amounts of \emph{Implicit Self-Regularization}. For smaller and/or older DNNs, this Implicit Self-Regularization is like traditional Tikhonov regularization, in that there is a `size scale' separating signal from noise. For state-of-the-art DNNs, however, we identify a novel form of \emph{Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization}, similar to the self-organization seen in the statistical physics of disordered systems. This implicit Self-Regularization can depend strongly on the many knobs of the training process. By exploiting the generalization gap phenomena, we demonstrate that we can cause a small model to exhibit all 5+1 phases of training simply by changing the batch size.},

The resulting grammar is encoded by exploring some redundancies, such as common prefixes between suffix rules, which are sorted according to SAIS framework.

abstract = {Providing quality-of-service (QoS) guarantees in packet networks gives rise to several challenging issues. One of them is how to determine a feasible path that satisfies a set of constraints while maintaining high utilization of network resources. The latter objective implies the need to impose an additional optimality requirement on the feasibility problem. This can be done through a primary cost function (e.g., administrative weight, hop count) according to which the selected feasible path is optimal. In general, multi-constrained path selection, with or without optimization, is an NP-complete problem that cannot be exactly solved in polynomial-time. Heuristics and approximation algorithms with polynomial and pseudo-polynomial-time complexities are often used to deal with this problem. However, existing solutions suffer either from excessive computational complexities that cannot be used for online network operation or from low performance. Moreover, they only deal with special cases of the problem (e.g., two constraints without optimization, one constraint with optimization, etc.). For the feasibility problem under multiple constraints, some researchers have proposed a nonlinear cost function whose minimization provides a continuous spectrum of solutions ranging from a generalized linear approximation (GLA) to an asymptotically exact solution. We propose an efficient heuristic algorithm for the most general form of the problem. We first formalize the theoretical properties of the above nonlinear cost function. We then introduce our heuristic algorithm (H MCOP), which attempts to minimize both the nonlinear cost function (for the feasibility part) and the primary cost function (for the optimality part). We prove that H MCOP guarantees at least the performance of GLA and often improves upon it. H MCOP has the same order of complexity as Dijkstra's algorithm. Using extensive simulations on random graphs with correlated and uncorrelated link weights, we show that under the same level of computational complexity, H MCOP outperforms its (less general) contenders in its success rate in finding feasible paths and in the cost of such paths},

The analysis of smart grid operation requires considering the reliability of the cyber network as it is neither invulnerable nor failure free. This paper quantitatively evaluates the reliability of modern power systems, which incorporates the impact of cyber network failures on the reliability of the power network. In this paper, four types of interdependencies are defined and a new concept of state mapping is proposed to map the failures in the cyber network to the failures of the power network. Furthermore, in order to evaluate the impact of direct cyber-power interdependencies on the reliability indices, two optimization models are introduced to maximize the data connection in the cyber network and minimize the load shedding in the power network. The effectiveness of proposed reliability evaluation method is shown by a smart microgrid application. The methodology presented in this paper is a start point to optimize the future power grid which has increasingly interdependencies between cyber and power networks.},

This problem is a novel version of the influence maximization problem that necessitates new analysis incorporating the type of propagation on each layer of the multiplex. We identify a new property, generalized deterministic submodular, which when satisfied by the propagation in each layer, ensures that the propagation on the multiplex overall is submodular-for this case, we formulate influential seed finder (ISF), the greedy algorithm with approximation ratio (1-1/e). Since the size of a multiplex comprising multiple OSNs may encompass billions of users, we formulate an algorithm knapsack seeding of network (KSN) that runs on each layer of the multiplex in parallel. KSN takes an  & #x03B1;-approximation algorithm A for the influence maximization problem on a single network as input, and has approximation ratio ((1 -  & #x03B5;)  & #x03B1;)/((o + 1)k) for arbitrary  & #x03B5;  & #x003E; 0, o is the number of overlapping users, and k is the number of layers in the multiplex.

abstract = {It is generally believed that submodular functions and the more general class of $\gamma$-weakly submodular functions-may only be optimized under the non-negativity assumption f (S) ≥ 0. In this paper, we show that once the function is expressed as the difference f = g − c, where g is monotone, non-negative, and $\gamma$-weakly submod-ular and c is non-negative modular, then strong approximation guarantees may be obtained. We present an algorithm for maximizing g − c under a k-cardinality constraint which produces a random feasible set S such that E [g(S)−c(S)] ≥ (1 − e −$\gamma$ −)g(OPT)−c(OPT), whose running time is O(n log 2 1), independent of k. We extend these results to the unconstrained setting by describing an algorithm with the same approximation guarantees and faster O(n log 1) runtime. The main techniques underlying our algorithms are twofold: the use of a surrogate objective which varies the relative importance between g and c throughout the algorithm, and a geometric sweep over possible $\gamma$ values. Our algorithmic guarantees are complemented by a hardness result showing that no polynomial-time algorithm which accesses g through a value oracle can do better. We empirically demonstrate the success of our algorithms by applying them to experimental design on the Boston Housing dataset and directed vertex cover on the Email EU dataset.},

By carefully subsampling each element of data stream, our algorithm enjoys the tightest approximation guarantees in various settings while having the smallest memory footprint and requiring the lowest number of function evaluations. More specifically, for a monotone submodular function and a $p$-matchoid constraint, our randomized algorithm achieves a $4p$ approximation ratio (in expectation) with $O(k)$ memory and $O(km/p)$ queries per element ($k$ is the size of the largest feasible solution and $m$ is the number of matroids used to define the constraint). For the non-monotone case, our approximation ratio increases only slightly to $4p+2-o(1)$. To the best or our knowledge, our algorithm is the first that combines the benefits of streaming and subsampling in a novel way in order to truly scale submodular maximization to massive machine learning problems. To showcase its practicality, we empirically evaluated the performance of our algorithm on a video summarization application and observed that it outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithm by up to fifty fold, while maintaining practically the same utility.},

abstract = {Submodular functions are a broad class of set functions, which naturally arise in diverse areas. Many algorithms have been suggested for the maximization of these functions. Unfortunately, once the function deviates from submodularity, the known algorithms may perform arbitrarily poorly. Amending this issue, by obtaining approximation results for set functions generalizing submodular functions, has been the focus of recent works. One such class, known as weakly submodular functions, has received a lot of attention. A key result proved by Das and Kempe (2011) showed that the approximation ratio of the greedy algorithm for weakly submodular maximization subject to a cardinality constraint degrades smoothly with the distance from submodularity. However, no results have been obtained for maximization subject to constraints beyond cardinality. In particular, it is not known whether the greedy algorithm achieves any non-trivial approximation ratio for such constraints. In this paper, we prove that a randomized version of the greedy algorithm (previously used by Buchbinder et al. (2014) for a different problem) achieves an approximation ratio of $(1 + 1/\gamma)^{-2}$ for the maximization of a weakly submodular function subject to a general matroid constraint, where $\gamma$ is a parameter measuring the distance of the function from submodularity. Moreover, we also experimentally compare the performance of this version of the greedy algorithm on real world problems against natural benchmarks, and show that the algorithm we study performs well also in practice. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first algorithm with a non-trivial approximation guarantee for maximizing a weakly submodular function subject to a constraint other than the simple cardinality constraint. In particular, it is the first algorithm with such a guarantee for the important and broad class of matroid constraints.},

Conventional wisdom attributes small generalization error either to properties of the model family, or to the regularization techniques used during training. Through extensive systematic experiments, we show how these traditional approaches fail to explain why large neural networks generalize well in practice. Specifically, our experiments establish that state-of-the-art convolutional networks for image classification trained with stochastic gradient methods easily fit a random labeling of the training data. This phenomenon is qualitatively unaffected by explicit regularization, and occurs even if we replace the true images by completely unstructured random noise. We corroborate these experimental findings with a theoretical construction showing that simple depth two neural networks already have perfect finite sample expressivity as soon as the number of parameters exceeds the number of data points as it usually does in practice. We interpret our experimental findings by comparison with traditional models.},

To tackle this problem, an incremental clustering algorithm by fast finding and searching of density peaks based on k-mediods is proposed in this paper. In the proposed algorithm, two cluster operations, namely cluster creating and cluster merging, are defined to integrate the current pattern into the previous one for the final clustering result, and k-mediods is employed to modify the clustering centers according to the new arriving objects. Finally, experiments are conducted to validate the proposed scheme on three popular UCI datasets and two real datasets collected from industrial Internet of Things in terms of clustering accuracy and computational time.},

abstract = {Tree search algorithms, such as branch-and-bound, are the most widely used tools for solving combinatorial and nonconvex problems. For example, they are the foremost method for solving (mixed) integer programs and constraint satisfaction problems. Tree search algorithms recursively partition the search space to find an optimal solution. In order to keep the tree size small, it is crucial to carefully decide, when expanding a tree node, which question (typically variable) to branch on at that node in order to partition the remaining space. Numerous partitioning techniques (e.g., variable selection) have been proposed, but there is no theory describing which technique is optimal. We show how to use machine learning to determine an optimal weighting of any set of partitioning procedures for the instance distribution at hand using samples from the distribution. We provide the first sample complexity guarantees for tree search algorithm configuration. These guarantees bound the number of samples sufficient to ensure that the empirical performance of an algorithm over the samples nearly matches its expected performance on the unknown instance distribution. This thorough theoretical investigation naturally gives rise to our learning algorithm. Via experiments, we show that learning an optimal weighting of partitioning procedures can dramatically reduce tree size, and we prove that this reduction can even be exponential. Through theory and experiments, we show that learning to branch is both practical and hugely beneficial.},

abstract = {In this paper, we study the problem of robust influence maximization in the independent cascade model under a hyperparametric assumption. In social networks users influence and are influenced by individuals with similar characteristics and as such, they are associated with some features. A recent surging research direction in influence maximization focuses on the case where the edge probabilities on the graph are not arbitrary but are generated as a function of the features of the users and a global hyperparameter. We propose a model where the objective is to maximize the worst-case number of influenced users for any possible value of that hyperparameter. We provide theoretical results showing that proper robust solution in our model is NP-hard and an algorithm that achieves improper robust optimization. We make-use of sampling based techniques and of the renowned multiplicative weight updates algorithm. Additionally, we validate our method empirically and prove that it outperforms the state-of-the-art robust influence maximization techniques.},

Although algorithms that can assemble a large amount of RNA-Seq data are available, they are generally very memory-intensive and can only be used to construct small assemblies. We develop a divide-and-conquer strategy that allows these algorithms to be utilized, by subdividing a large RNA-Seq data set into small libraries. Each individual library is assembled independently by an existing algorithm, and a merging algorithm is developed to combine these assemblies by picking a subset of high quality transcripts to form a large transcriptome. When compared to existing algorithms that return a single assembly directly, this strategy achieves comparable or increased accuracy as memory-efficient algorithms that can be used to process a large amount of RNA-Seq data, and comparable or decreased accuracy as memory-intensive algorithms that can only be used to construct small assemblies. Our divide-and-conquer strategy allows memory-intensive de novo transcriptome assembly algorithms to be utilized to construct large assemblies.},

abstract = {The largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix of a network (referred to as the spectral radius) is an important metric in its own right. Further, for several models of epidemic spread on networks (e.g., the ‘flu-like' SISmodel), it has been shown that an epidemic dies out quickly if the spectral radius of the graph is below a certain threshold that depends on themodel parameters. This motivates a strategy to control epidemic spread by reducing the spectral radius of the underlying network. In this paper, we develop a suite of provable approxima- tion algorithms for reducing the spectral radius by removing the minimum cost set of edges (modeling quarantining) or nodes (modeling vaccinations), with different time and qual- ity tradeoffs. Our main algorithm, GreedyWalk, is based on the idea of hitting closed walks of a given length, and gives an O(log2 n)-approximation, where n denotes the number of nodes; it also performs much better in practice compared to all prior heuristics proposed for this problem. We further present a novel sparsification method to improve its running time. In addition, we give a new primal-dual based algorithm with an even better approximation guarantee (O(log n)), albeit with slower running time. We also give lower bounds on the worst-case performance of some of the popular heuristics. Finally we demonstrate the applicability of our algorithms and the properties of our solutions via extensive experiments on multiple synthetic and real networks},

The balancing of those two tendencies typically shapes a synaptic landscape with configurations which are barely stable, and therefore highly flexible. This allows for swift adaptation to new situations. Recollection of past successes is achieved by punishing synapses which have once participated in activity associated with successful outputs much less than neurons that have never been successful. Despite its simplicity, the model can readily learn to solve complicated nonlinear tasks, even in the presence of noise. In particular, the learning time for the benchmark parity problem scales algebraically with the problem size N, with an exponent k∼1.4.},

We show that our randomized algorithm, STOCHASTIC-GREEDY, can achieve a $(1-1/e-\varepsilon)$ approximation guarantee, in expectation, to the optimum solution in time linear in the size of the data and independent of the cardinality constraint. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm on submodular functions arising in data summarization, including training large-scale kernel methods, exemplar-based clustering, and sensor placement. We observe that STOCHASTIC-GREEDY practically achieves the same utility value as lazy greedy but runs much faster. More surprisingly, we observe that in many practical scenarios STOCHASTIC-GREEDY does not evaluate the whole fraction of data points even once and still achieves indistinguishable results compared to lazy greedy.},

Our algorithm takes the amount of available memory as an input parameter, and tries to make the best use of it by splitting the input collection into subcollections sufficiently small that it can compute their BWT in RAM using an optimal linear time algorithm. Next, it merges the partial BWTs in external memory and in the process it also computes the LCP values. We prove that our algorithm performs O(n AveLcp) sequential I/Os, where n is the total length of the collection, and AveLcp is the average Longest Common Prefix of the collection. This bound is an improvement over the known algorithms for the same task. The experimental results show that our algorithm outperforms the current best algorithm for collections of sequences with different lengths and for collections with relatively small average Longest Common Prefix. In the second part of the paper, we show that our algorithm can be modified to output two additional arrays that, used with the BWT and LCP arrays, provide simple, scan based, external memory algorithms for three well known problems in bioinformatics: the computation of maximal repeats, the all pairs suffix-prefix overlaps, and the construction of succinct de Bruijn graphs.

abstract = {Many applications in machine learning require optimizing a function whose true gradient is unknown, but where surrogate gradient information (directions that may be correlated with, but not necessarily identical to, the true gradient) is available instead. This arises when an approximate gradient is easier to compute than the full gradient (e.g. in meta-learning or unrolled optimization), or when a true gradient is intractable and is replaced with a surrogate (e.g. in certain reinforcement learning applications, or when using synthetic gradients). We propose Guided Evolutionary Strategies, a method for optimally using surrogate gradient directions along with random search. We define a search distribution for evolutionary strategies that is elongated along a guiding subspace spanned by the surrogate gradients. This allows us to estimate a descent direction which can then be passed to a first-order optimizer. We analytically and numerically characterize the tradeoffs that result from tuning how strongly the search distribution is stretched along the guiding subspace, and we use this to derive a setting of the hyperparameters that works well across problems. Finally, we apply our method to example problems, demonstrating an improvement over both standard evolutionary strategies and first-order methods (that directly follow the surrogate gradient).

abstract = {In this paper, we study the set cover problem in the fully dynamic model. In this model, the set of active elements, i.e., those that must be covered at any given time, can change due to element arrivals and departures. The goal is to maintain an algorithmic solution that is competitive with respect to the current optimal solution. This model is popular in both the dynamic algorithms and online algorithms communities. The difference is in the restriction placed on the algorithm: in dynamic algorithms, the running time of the algorithm making updates (called update time) is bounded, while in online algorithms, the number of updates made to the solution (called recourse) is limited. In this paper we show the following results: In the update time setting, we obtain O(log n)-competitiveness with O(f log n) amortized update time, and O(f^3)-competitiveness with O(f^2) update time. The O(log n)-competitive algorithm is the first one to achieve a competitive ratio independent of f in this setting. In the recourse setting, we show a competitive ratio of O(min{log n,f}) with constant amortized recourse. Note that this matches the best offline bounds with just constant recourse, something that is impossible in the classical online model. Our results are based on two algorithmic frameworks in the fully-dynamic model that are inspired by the classic greedy and primal-dual algorithms for offline set cover. We show that both frameworks can be used for obtaining both recourse and update time bounds, thereby demonstrating algorithmic techniques common to these strands of research.},

abstract = {In this paper, we study crucial elements of a complex network, namely its nodes and connections, which play a key role in maintaining the network's structure and function under unexpected structural perturbations of nodes and edges removal. Specifically, we want to identify vital nodes and edges whose failure (either random or intentional) will break the most number of connected triples (or triangles) in the network. This problem is extremely important because connected triples form the foundation of strong connections in many real-world systems, such as mutual relationships in social networks, reliable data transmission in communication networks, and stable routing strategies in mobile networks. Disconnected triples, analog to broken mutual connections, can greatly affect the network's structure and disrupt its normal function, which can further lead to the corruption of the entire system. The analysis of such crucial elements will shed light on key factors behind the resilience and robustness of many complex systems in practice. We formulate the analysis under multiple optimization problems and show their intractability. We next propose efficient approximation algorithms, namely DAK-n and DAK-e, which guarantee an $(1-1/e)$-approximate ratio (compared to the overall optimal solutions) while having the same time complexity as the best triangle counting and listing algorithm on power-law networks.

In an application perspective, we perform comprehensive experiments on real social traces with millions of nodes and billions of edges. These empirical experiments indicate that our approaches achieve comparably better results while are up to 100x faster than current state-of-the-art methods.},

Experiments on MuJoCo and Atari show that ES is a viable solution strategy that scales extremely well with the number of CPUs available: By using a novel communication strategy based on common random numbers, our ES implementation only needs to communicate scalars, making it possible to scale to over a thousand parallel workers. This allows us to solve 3D humanoid walking in 10 minutes and obtain competitive results on most Atari games after one hour of training. In addition, we highlight several advantages of ES as a black box optimization technique: it is invariant to action frequency and delayed rewards, tolerant of extremely long horizons, and does not need temporal discounting or value function approximation.},

abstract = {Brands and agencies use marketing as a tool to influence customers. One of the major decisions in a marketing plan deals with the allocation of a given budget among media channels in order to maximize the impact on a set of potential customers. A similar situation occurs in a social network, where a marketing budget needs to be distributed among a set of potential influencers in a way that provides high-impact. We introduce several probabilistic models to capture the above scenarios. The common setting of these models consists of a bipartite graph of source and target nodes. The objective is to allocate a fixed budget among the source nodes to maximize the expected number of influenced target nodes. The concrete way in which source nodes influence target nodes depends on the underlying model. We primarily consider two models: a source-side influence model, in which a source node that is allocated a budget of k makes k independent trials to influence each of its neighboring target nodes, and a target-side influence model, in which a target node becomes influenced according to a specified rule that depends on the overall budget allocated to its neighbors. Our main results are an optimal (1 - 1/e)-approximation algorithm for the source-side model, and several inapproximability results for the target-side model, establishing that influence maximization in the latter model is provably harder.},

Information received via friends tends to be trusted, and online social networks allow individuals to transmit information to many friends at once. By referencing known rumors from Snopes.com, a popular website documenting memes and urban legends, we track the propagation of thousands of rumors appearing on Facebook. From this sample we infer the rates at which rumors from different categories and of varying truth value are uploaded and reshared. We find that rumor cascades run deeper in the social network than reshare cascades in general. We then examine the effect of individual reshares receiving a comment containing a link to a Snopes article on the evolution of the cascade. We find that receiving such a comment increases the likelihood that a reshare of a rumor will be deleted. Furthermore, large cascades are able to accumulate hundreds of Snopes comments while continuing to propagate. Finally, using a dataset of rumors copied and pasted from one status update to another, we show that rumors change over time and that different variants tend to dominate different bursts in popularity.},

Influence maximization refers to the process of finding influential users who make the most of information or product adoption. An independent cascade-based model for influence maximization, called IMIC-OC, was proposed to calculate positive influence. We assumed that influential users spread positive opinions. At the beginning, users held positive or negative opinions as their initial opinions. When more users became involved in the discussions, users balanced their own opinions and those of their neighbors. The number of users who did not change positive opinions was used to determine positive influence. Corresponding influential users who had maximum positive influence were then obtained. Experiments were conducted on three real networks, namely, Facebook, HEP-PH and Epinions, to calculate maximum positive influence based on the IMIC-OC model and two other baseline methods. The proposed model resulted in larger positive influence, thus indicating better performance compared with the baseline methods.},

A key concept is introduced, the edge multiplicity, that measures the number of triangles passing through an edge. This quantity extends the clustering coefficient in that it involves the properties of two-and not just one-vertices. The formalism is completed with the definition of a three-vertex correlation function, which is the fundamental quantity describing the properties of clustered networks. The formalism suggests different metrics that are able to thoroughly characterize transitive relations. A rigorous analysis of several real networks, which makes use of this formalism and the metrics, is also provided. It is also found that clustered networks can be classified into two main groups: the weak and the strong transitivity classes. In the first class, edge multiplicity is small, with triangles being disjoint. In the second class, edge multiplicity is high and so triangles share many edges. As we shall see in the following paper, the class a network belongs to has strong implications in its percolation properties.},

abstract = {A well-known fact in the field of lossless text compression is that high-order entropy is a weak model when the input contains long repetitions. Motivated by this fact, decades of research have generated myriads of so-called dictionary compressors: algorithms able to reduce the text's size by exploiting its repetitiveness. Lempel-Ziv 77 is probably one of the most successful and known tools of this kind, followed by straight-line programs, run-length Burrows-Wheeler transform, and other less-known schemes. In this paper, we show that these techniques are different solutions to the same, elegant, combinatorial problem: to find a small set of positions capturing all distinct text's substrings. We call such a set a string attractor. We first show reductions between dictionary compressors and string attractors. This gives us the approximation ratios of dictionary compressors with respect to the smallest string attractor and allows us to solve several open problems related to the asymptotic relations between the output sizes of different dictionary compressors. We then show that the k-attractor problem - that is, deciding whether a text has a size-t set of positions capturing all substrings of length at most k - is NP-complete for k >= 3. We provide approximation techniques for the smallest k-attractor, show that the problem is APX-complete for constant k, and give strong inapproximability results. To conclude, we provide matching lower- and upper- bounds for the random access problem on string attractors. Our optimal data structure is universal: by our reductions to string attractors, it supports random access on any dictionary-compression scheme. In particular, our solution matches the lower bound also on LZ77, straight-line programs, collage systems, and macro schemes, and therefore essentially closes (at once) the random access problem for all these compressors.},

The dynamics that governs the spread of influence is the following: initially only elements in S are influenced; subsequently at each round, the set of influenced elements is augmented by all nodes in the network that have a sufficiently large number of already influenced neighbors. We prove that the problem is NP-hard, even in simple networks like complete graphs and trees. We also derive a series of positive results.

abstract = {The execution cost of a program, both in terms of time and energy, comprises computational cost and data movement cost (e.g., cost of transferring data between CPU and memory devices, between parallel processors, etc.). Technology trends will cause data movement to account for the majority of energy expenditure and execution time on emerging computers. Therefore, computational complexity alone will no longer be a sufficient metric for comparing algorithms, and a fundamental characterization of data movement complexity will be increasingly important. In their seminal work, Hong & Kung proposed the red-blue pebble game to model the data movement complexity of algorithms. Using the pebble game abstraction, Hong & Kung proved tight asymptotic lower bounds for the data movement complexity of several algorithms by reformulating the problem as a graph partitioning problem. In this dissertation, we develop a novel alternate graph min-cut based lower bounding technique. Using our technique, we derive tight lower bounds for different algorithms, with upper bounds matching within a constant factor. Further, we develop a dynamic analysis based automated heuristic for our technique, which enables automatic analysis of arbitrary computations. We provide several use cases for our automated approach. This dissertation also presents a technique, built upon the ideas of Christ et al., to derive asymptotic parametric lower bounds for a sub-class of computations, called affine computations. A static analysis based heuristic to automatically derive parametric lower bounds for affine parts of the computations is also presented. Motivated by the emerging interest in large scale parallel systems with interconnection networks and hierarchical caches with varying bandwidths at different levels, we extend the pebble game model to parallel system architecture to characterize the data movement requirements in large scale parallel computers. We provide interesting insights on architectural bottlenecks that limit the performance of algorithms on these parallel machines. Finally, using data movement complexity analysis, in conjunction with the roofline model for performance bounds, we perform an algorithm-architecture codesign exploration across an architectural design space. We model the maximal achievable performance and energy efficiency of different algorithms for a given VLSI technology, considering different architectural parameters.},

abstract = {Evolution strategies (ES) are a family of black-box optimization algorithms able to train deep neural networks roughly as well as Q-learning and policy gradient methods on challenging deep reinforcement learning (RL) problems, but are much faster (e.g. hours vs. days) because they parallelize better. However, many RL problems require directed exploration because they have reward functions that are sparse or deceptive (i.e. contain local optima), and it is unknown how to encourage such exploration with ES. Here we show that algorithms that have been invented to promote directed exploration in small-scale evolved neural networks via populations of exploring agents, specifically novelty search (NS) and quality diversity (QD) algorithms, can be hybridized with ES to improve its performance on sparse or deceptive deep RL tasks, while retaining scalability. Our experiments confirm that the resultant new algorithms, NS-ES and two QD algorithms, NSR-ES and NSRA-ES, avoid local optima encountered by ES to achieve higher performance on Atari and simulated robots learning to walk around a deceptive trap. This paper thus introduces a family of fast, scalable algorithms for reinforcement learning that are capable of directed exploration. It also adds this new family of exploration algorithms to the RL toolbox and raises the interesting possibility that analogous algorithms with multiple simultaneous paths of exploration might also combine well with existing RL algorithms outside ES.},

The problem has been extensively studied but most works focus on the submodular influence diffusion models. In this paper, motivated by empirical evidences, we explore influence maximization in the non-submodular regime. In particular, we study the general threshold model in which a fraction of nodes have non-submodular threshold functions, but their threshold functions are closely upper-and lower-bounded by some submodular functions (we call them $\epsilon$-almost submodular). We first show a strong hardness result: there is no 1/n $\gamma$/c approximation for influence maximization (unless P = NP) for all networks with up to n $\gamma$ $\epsilon$-almost submodular nodes, where $\gamma$ is in (0,1) and c is a parameter depending on $\epsilon$. This indicates that influence maximization is still hard to approximate even though threshold functions are close to submodular. We then provide (1 − $\epsilon$) (1 − 1/e) approximation algorithms when the number of $\epsilon$-almost submodular nodes is . Finally, we conduct experiments on a number of real-world datasets, and the results demonstrate that our approximation algorithms outperform other baseline algorithms.},

abstract = {One of the most central problems in viral marketing is Influence Maximization (IM), which finds a set of $k$ seed users who can influence the maximum number of users in online social networks. Unfortunately, all existing algorithms to IM, including the state of the art SSA and IMM, have an approximation ratio of $(1 - 1/e - \epsilon)$. Recently, a generalization of IM, Cost-aware Target Viral Marketing (CTVM), asks for the most cost-effective users to influence the most relevant users, has been introduced. The current best algorithm for CTVM has an approximation ratio of $(1 - 1 /\sqrt{e} - \epsilon)$. In this paper, we study the CTVM problem, aiming to optimally solve the problem. We first highlight that using a traditional two stage stochastic programming to exactly solve CTVM is not possible because of scalability. We then propose an almost exact algorithm TipTop, which has an approximation ratio of $(1 - \epsilon)$. This result significantly improves the current best solutions to both IM and CTVM. At the heart of TipTop lies an innovative technique that reduces the number of samples as much as possible. This allows us to exactly solve CTVM on a much smaller space of generated samples using Integer Programming. While obtaining an almost exact solution, TipTop is very scalable, running on billion-scale networks such as Twitter under three hours. Furthermore, TipTop lends a tool for researchers to benchmark their solutions against the optimal one in large-scale networks, which is currently not available.},

There was considerable heterogeneity (I2=84.0%; T2=0.058) and no evidence of publication bias.

Most studies evaluated multi-component interventions, posing problems in isolating the specific effect of the SNS. Health behavior change theories were seldom mentioned in the included articles, but two particularly innovative studies used ‘network alteration', showing a positive effect. Overall, SNS interventions appeared to be effective in promoting changes in health-related behaviors, and further research regarding the application of these promising tools is warranted.

Here, we introduce a framework for similarity search based on characterizing a dataset's entropy and fractal dimension. We prove that searching scales in time with metric entropy (number of covering hyperspheres), if the fractal dimension of the dataset is low, and scales in space with the sum of metric entropy and information-theoretic entropy (randomness of the data). Using these ideas, we present accelerated versions of standard tools, with no loss in specificity and little loss in sensitivity, for use in three domains - high-throughput drug screening (Ammolite, 150× speedup), metagenomics (MICA, 3.5× speedup of DIAMOND [3,700× BLASTX]), and protein structure search (esFragBag, 10× speedup of FragBag). Our framework can be used to achieve "'compressive omics," and the general theory can be readily applied to data science problems outside of biology (source code: http://gems.csail.mit.edu).},

We then quantify, analytically and by simulation, the influence of the model parameters on the basic characteristics of the retweet graph, such as the density of edges and the size and density of the LCC.

Although the assembly contiguity has increased, it still does not span a chromosome or an arm of the chromosome, resulting in an unfinished chromosome level assembly. To address this problem, we develop a scalable and computationally efficient scaffolding method that can boost the contiguity of the assembly by a large extent using genome wide chromatin interaction data such as Hi-C. Particularly, we demonstrate an algorithm that uses Hi-C data for longer-range scaffolding of de novo long read genome assemblies. We tested our methods on two long read assemblies of different organisms. We compared our method with previously developed method and show that our approach performs better in terms of accuracy of scaffolding.

Using publicly available data, a gene coexpression network (GCN) can be constructed and used for gene function prediction, candidate gene selection, and improving understanding of regulatory pathways. Several GCN studies have been done in maize (Zea mays), mostly using microarray datasets. To build an optimal GCN from plant materials RNA-Seq data, parameters for expression data normalization and network inference were evaluated. A comprehensive evaluation of these two parameters and a ranked aggregation strategy on network performance, using libraries from 1266 maize samples, were conducted. Three normalization methods and 10 inference methods, including six correlation and four mutual information methods, were tested. The three normalization methods had very similar performance. For network inference, correlation methods performed better than mutual information methods at some genes. Increasing sample size also had a positive effect on GCN. Aggregating single networks together resulted in improved performance compared to single networks.},

abstract = {Most community detection methods use network topology and edge density to identify optimal communities. However, in these methods, several objects that are connected by high weights may be decomposed into different communities, even when they intuitively belong to a single community. In this case, it is more effective to classify the objects into the same community because they perform important roles in controlling and understanding the network. To achieve this goal, in this paper, we propose a method of detecting optimal community structures in a complex network using interaction-based edge clustering. Our approach is to consider network topology as well as interaction density when identifying overlapping and hierarchical communities. Additionally, we measure the differences between the quantity and quality of intra- and inter-community interactions to evaluate the quality of the community structure. We test our method on several benchmark networks with known community structures. Additionally, after applying our method to several real-world complex networks, we evaluate our method through comparison with other methods. We find that the community quality and the overlap quality for our method surpass the results of the other methods.},

abstract = {Link prediction is a key problem for network-structured data. Link prediction heuristics use some score functions, such as common neighbors and Katz index, to measure the likelihood of links. They have obtained wide practical uses due to their simplicity, interpretability, and for some of them, scalability. However, every heuristic has a strong assumption on when two nodes are likely to link, which limits their effectiveness on networks where these assumptions fail. In this regard, a more reasonable way should be learning a suitable heuristic from a given network instead of using predefined ones. By extracting a local subgraph around each target link, we aim to learn a function mapping the subgraph patterns to link existence, thus automatically learning a `heuristic' that suits the current network. In this paper, we study this heuristic learning paradigm for link prediction. First, we develop a novel $\gamma$-decaying heuristic theory. The theory unifies a wide range of heuristics in a single framework, and proves that all these heuristics can be well approximated from local subgraphs. Our results show that local subgraphs reserve rich information related to link existence. Second, based on the $\gamma$-decaying theory, we propose a new algorithm to learn heuristics from local subgraphs using a graph neural network (GNN). Its experimental results show unprecedented performance, working consistently well on a wide range of problems.},

In light of this capacity for overfitting, it is remarkable that simple algorithms like SGD reliably return solutions with low test error. One roadblock to explaining these phenomena in terms of implicit regularization, structural properties of the solution, and/or easiness of the data is that many learning bounds are quantitatively vacuous when applied to networks learned by SGD in this "deep learning" regime. Logically, in order to explain generalization, we need nonvacuous bounds. We return to an idea by Langford and Caruana (2001), who used PAC-Bayes bounds to compute nonvacuous numerical bounds on generalization error for stochastic two-layer two-hidden-unit neural networks via a sensitivity analysis. By optimizing the PAC-Bayes bound directly, we are able to extend their approach and obtain nonvacuous generalization bounds for deep stochastic neural network classifiers with millions of parameters trained on only tens of thousands of examples. We connect our findings to recent and old work on flat minima and MDL-based explanations of generalization.},

abstract = {In this paper, we focus on the efficient and scalable processing of setreachability queries over a distributed, directed data graph. A setreachability query is a generalized form of a reachability query, in which we consider two sets S and T of source and target vertices, respectively, to be given as the query. The result of a setreachability query are all pairs of source and target vertices (s, t), with s ∈ S and t ∈ T , where s is reachable to t (denoted as S ; T). In case the data graph is partitioned into multiple, edgeand vertexdisjoint subgraphs (e.g., when distributed across multiple compute nodes in a cluster), we refer to the resulting setreachability problem as distributed set reachability. The key goal in processing a distributed setreachability query over a partitioned data graph both efficiently and in a scalable manner is (1) to avoid redundant computations within the local compute nodes as much as possible, (2) to partially evaluate the local components of a setreachability query S ; T among all compute nodes in parallel, and (3) to minimize both the size and number of messages exchanged among the compute nodes. Distributed set reachability has a plethora of applications in graph analytics and for query processing. The current W3C recommendation for SPARQL 1.1, for example, introduces a notion of labeled property paths which resolves to processing a form of generalized graphpattern queries with setreachability predicates. Moreover, analyzing dependencies among socialnetwork communities inherently involves reachability checks between large sets of source and target vertices. Our experiments confirm very significant performance gains of our approach in comparison to stateoftheart graph engines such as Giraph ++ , and over a variety of graph collections with up to 1.4 billion edges.},

In this work we present \emph{Population Based Training (PBT)}, a simple asynchronous optimisation algorithm which effectively utilises a fixed computational budget to jointly optimise a population of models and their hyperparameters to maximise performance. Importantly, PBT discovers a schedule of hyperparameter settings rather than following the generally sub-optimal strategy of trying to find a single fixed set to use for the whole course of training. With just a small modification to a typical distributed hyperparameter training framework, our method allows robust and reliable training of models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of PBT on deep reinforcement learning problems, showing faster wall-clock convergence and higher final performance of agents by optimising over a suite of hyperparameters. In addition, we show the same method can be applied to supervised learning for machine translation, where PBT is used to maximise the BLEU score directly, and also to training of Generative Adversarial Networks to maximise the Inception score of generated images. In all cases PBT results in the automatic discovery of hyperparameter schedules and model selection which results in stable training and better final performance.},

abstract = {Single-cell RNA sequencing enables the construction of trajectories describing the dynamic changes in gene expression underlying biological processes such as cell differentiation and development. The comparison of single-cell trajectories under two distinct conditions can illuminate the differences and similarities between the two and can thus be a powerful tool. Recently developed methods for the comparison of trajectories rely on the concept of dynamic time warping (dtw), which was originally proposed for the comparison of two time series. Consequently, these methods are restricted to simple, linear trajectories. Here, we adopt and theoretically link arboreal matchings to dtw and propose an algorithm to compare complex trajectories that more realistically contain branching points that divert cells into different fates. We implement a suite of exact and heuristic algorithms suitable for the comparison of trajectories of different characteristics in our tool Trajan. Trajan automatically pairs similar biological processes between conditions and aligns them in a globally consistent manner. In an alignment of single-cell trajectories describing human muscle differentiation and myogenic reprogramming, Trajan identifies and aligns the core paths without prior information. From Trajan's alignment, we are able to reproduce recently reported barriers to reprogramming. In a perturbation experiment, we demonstrate the benefits in terms of robustness and accuracy of our model which compares entire trajectories at once, as opposed to a pairwise application of dtw.

Additionally, it is desirable to track the low-rank structure as the graph evolves over time, efficiently and within limited storage. Real graphs typically have thousands or millions of nodes, but are usually very sparse. However, standard decompositions such as SVD do not preserve sparsity. This has led to the development of methods such as CUR and CMD, which seek a non-orthogonal basis by sampling the columns and/or rows of the sparse matrix.},

The clustering coefficient, reflecting the local configuration of triangles, can be seen as a special case of this approach. In this paper we generalize this method for weighted networks. We introduce subgraph "intensity" as the geometric mean of its link weights "coherence" as the ratio of the geometric to the corresponding arithmetic mean. Using these measures, motif scores and clustering coefficient can be generalized to weighted networks. To demonstrate these concepts, we apply them to financial and metabolic networks and find that inclusion of weights may considerably modify the conclusions obtained from the study of unweighted characteristics.},

In this paper, we develop a theoretical approach to study clique percolation in Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi graphs, which gives not only the exact solutions of the critical point, but also the corresponding order parameter. Based on this, we prove theoretically that the fraction $\psi$ of cliques in the giant clique cluster always makes a continuous phase transition as the classical percolation. However, the fraction $\phi$ of vertices in the giant clique cluster for $l>1$ makes a step-function-like discontinuous phase transition in the thermodynamic limit and a continuous phase transition for $l=1$. More interesting, our analysis shows that at the critical point, the order parameter $\phi_c$ for $l>1$ is neither $0$ nor $1$, but a constant depending on $k$ and $l$. All these theoretical findings are in agreement with the simulation results, which give theoretical support and clarification for previous simulation studies of clique percolation.},

abstract = {In most natural and engineered systems, a set of entities interact with each other in complicated patterns that can encompass multiple types of relationships, change in time and include other types of complications. Such systems include multiple subsystems and layers of connectivity, and it is important to take such 'multilayer' features into account to try to improve our understanding of complex systems. Consequently, it is necessary to generalize 'traditional' network theory by developing (and validating) a framework and associated tools to study multilayer systems in a comprehensive fashion. The origins of such efforts date back several decades and arose in multiple disciplines, and now the study of multilayer networks has become one of the most important directions in network science. In this paper, we discuss the history of multilayer networks (and related concepts) and review the exploding body of work on such networks. To unify the disparate terminology in the large body of recent work, we discuss a general framework for multilayer networks, construct a dictionary of terminology to relate the numerous existing concepts to each other and provide a thorough discussion that compares, contrasts and translates between related notions such as multilayer networks, multiplex networks, interdependent networks, networks of networks and many others. We also survey and discuss existing data sets that can be represented as M. KIVEL{\"{A}} ET AL. multilayer networks. We review attempts to generalize singlelayernetwork diagnostics to multilayer networks. We also discuss the rapidly expanding research on multilayernetwork models and notions like community structure, connected components, tensor decompositions and various types of dynamical processes on multilayer networks. We conclude with a summary and an outlook.},

abstract = {We introduce network L-cloning, a technique for creating ensembles of random networks from any given real-world or artificial network. Each member of the ensemble is an L-cloned network constructed from L copies of the original network. The degree distribution of an L-cloned network and, more importantly, the degree-degree correlation between and beyond nearest neighbors are identical to those of the original network. The density of triangles in an L-cloned network, and hence its clustering coefficient, is reduced by a factor of L compared to those of the original network. Furthermore, the density of loops of any fixed length approaches zero for sufficiently large values of L. Other variants of L-cloning allow us to keep intact the short loops of certain lengths. As an application, we employ these network cloning methods to investigate the effect of short loops on dynamical processes running on networks and to inspect the accuracy of corresponding tree-based theories. We demonstrate that dynamics on L-cloned networks (with sufficiently large L) are accurately described by the so-called adjacency tree-based theories, examples of which include the message passing technique, some pair approximation methods, and the belief propagation algorithm used respectively to study bond percolation, SI epidemics, and the Ising model.},

The second algorithm is based on sampling and we prove an upper bound on the expected number of nodes it expands before reaching a set of goal states. We show that this algorithm is better suited for problems where many paths lead to a goal.

Quantifying the causal effect of these mediums on the dis- semination of information requires not only identification of who influences whom, but also of whether individuals would still propagate information in the absence of social sig- nals about that information. We examine the role of social networks in online information diffusion with a large-scale field experiment that randomizes exposure to signals about friends' information sharing among 253 million subjects in situ. Those who are exposed are significantly more likely to spread information, and do so sooner than those who are not exposed. We further examine the relative role of strong and weak ties in information propagation. We show that, although stronger ties are individually more influential, it is the more abundant weak ties who are responsible for the propagation of novel information. This suggests that weak ties may play a more dominant role in the dissemination of information online than currently believed. Categories},

abstract = {Graph datasets with billions of edges, such as social and Web graphs, are prevalent. To be feasible, computation on such large graphs should scale linearly with graph size. All-distances sketches (ADSs) are emerging as a powerful tool for scalable computation of some basic properties of individual nodes or the whole graph. ADSs were first proposed two decades ago (Cohen 1994) and more recent algorithms include ANF (Palmer, Gibbons, and Faloutsos 2002) and hyperANF (Boldi, Rosa, and Vigna 2011). A sketch of logarithmic size is computed for each node in the graph and the computation in total requires only a near linear number of edge relaxations. From the ADS of a node, we can estimate its neighborhood cardinalities (the number of nodes within some query distance) and closeness centrality. We make several contributions. We provide, for the first time, a unified exposition of ADS algorithms and applications. We present the Historic Inverse Probability (HIP) estimators which are applied to the ADS of a node to estimate a large natural class of queries including neighborhood cardinalities and closeness centralities. We show that our HIP estimators have at most half the variance of previous neighborhood cardinality estimators and that this is essentially optimal. Moreover, HIP obtains a polynomial improvement for more general queries and the estimators are simple, flexible, unbiased, and elegant. We apply HIP for approximate distinct counting on streams by comparing HIP and the original estimators applied to the HyperLogLog Min-Hash sketches (Flajolet et al. 2007). We demonstrate significant improvement in estimation quality for this state-of-the-art practical algorithm and also illustrate the ease of applying HIP. Finally, we study the quality of ADS estimation of distance ranges, generalizing the near-linear time factor-2 approximation of the diameter.},

abstract = {A modified shortest path network interdiction model is approximated in this work by a constrained binary knapsack which uses aggregated arc maximum flow as the objective function coefficient. In the modified shortest path network interdiction problem, an attacker selects a path of highest non-detection probability on a network with multiple origins and multiple available targets. A defender allocates a limited number of resources within the geographic region of the network to reduce the maximum network non-detection probability between all origin-target pairs by reducing arc non-detection probabilities and where path non-detection probability is modeled as a product of all arc non-detection probabilities on that path. Traditional decomposition methods to solve the shortest path network interdiction problem are sensitive to problem size and network/regional complexity. The goal of this paper is to develop a method for approximating the regional allocation of defense resources that maintains accuracy while reducing both computational effort and the sensitivity of computation time to network/regional properties. Statistical and spatial analysis methods are utilized to verify approximation performance of the knapsack method in two real-world networks. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Second, we propose a novel Graph Matching Network model that, given a pair of graphs as input, computes a similarity score between them by jointly reasoning on the pair through a new cross-graph attention-based matching mechanism. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our models on different domains including the challenging problem of control-flow-graph based function similarity search that plays an important role in the detection of vulnerabilities in software systems. The experimental analysis demonstrates that our models are not only able to exploit structure in the context of similarity learning but they can also outperform domain-specific baseline systems that have been carefully hand-engineered for these problems.},

This property has been studied extensively, but most of this research has been limited to clustering in single networks. The effect of clustering on the robustness of coupled networks, on the other hand, has received much less attention. Only the case of a pair of fully coupled networks with clustering has recently received study. Here we generalize the study of clustering of a fully coupled pair of networks and apply it to a partially interdependent network of networks with clustering within the network components. We show, both analytically and numerically, how clustering within networks affects the percolation properties of interdependent networks, including the percolation threshold, the size of the giant component, and the critical coupling point at which the firstorder phase transition changes to a secondorder phase transition as the coupling between the networks is reduced. We study two types of clustering, one proposed by Newman [Phys. Rev. Lett. 103, 058701 (2009)] in which the average degree is kept constant while the clustering is changed, and the other by Hackett et al. [Phys. Rev.

Smart Grid addresses the problem of existing power grid's increasing complexity, growing demand and requirement for greater reliability, through two-way communication and automated residential load control among others. These features also makes the Smart Grid a target for a number of cyber attacks. In the paper, we study the problem of rate alteration attack (RAA) through fabrication of price messages which induces changes in load profiles of individual users and eventually causes major alteration in the load profile of the entire network. Combining with cascading failure, it ends up with a highly damaging attack. We prove that the problem is NP-Complete and provide its inapproximability. We devise two approaches for the problem, former deals with maximizing failure of lines with the given resource and then extending the effect with cascading failure while the later takes cascading potential into account while choosing the lines to fail. To get more insight into the impact of RAA, we also extend our algorithms to maximize number of node failures. Empirical results on both IEEE Bus data and real network help us evaluate our approaches under various settings of grid parameters.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a new framework for designing fast parallel algorithms for fundamental statistical subset selection tasks that include feature selection and experimental design. Such tasks are known to be weakly submodular and are amenable to optimization via the standard greedy algorithm. Despite its desirable approximation guarantees, the greedy algorithm is inherently sequential and in the worst case, its parallel runtime is linear in the size of the data. Recently, there has been a surge of interest in a parallel optimization technique called adaptive sampling which produces solutions with desirable approximation guarantees for submodular maximization in exponentially faster parallel runtime. Unfortunately, we show that for general weakly submodular functions such accelerations are impossible. The major contribution in this paper is a novel relaxation of submod-ularity which we call differential submodularity. We first prove that differential submodularity characterizes objectives like feature selection and experimental design. We then design an adaptive sampling algorithm for differentially submodular functions whose parallel runtime is logarithmic in the size of the data and achieves strong approximation guarantees. Through experiments, we show the algorithm's performance is competitive with state-of-the-art methods and obtains dramatic speedups for feature selection and experimental design problems.},

For the case of monotone submodular functions and uniform cardinality constraints, we show that the GSEMO achieves a -approximation in expected polynomial time.

We find that, constraining the mean degree and the fraction of initially informed nodes, the optimal structure can be assortative (modular), core-periphery, or even disassortative. We then look for minimal cost structures, i.e. those such that a minimal fraction of initially informed nodes is needed to trigger a global cascade.

abstract = {Anyone who has worked with matroids has come away with the conviction that matroids are one of the richest and most useful ideas of our day. —Gian Carlo Rota [10] Why matroids? Have you noticed hidden connections between seemingly unrelated mathematical ideas? Strange that finding roots of polynomials can tell us important things about how to solve certain ordinary differential equations, or that computing a determinant would have anything to do with finding solutions to a linear system of equations. But this is one of the charming features of mathematics—that disparate objects share similar traits. Properties like independence appear in many contexts. Do you find independence everywhere you look? In 1933, three Harvard Junior Fellows unified this recurring theme in mathematics by defining a new mathematical object that they dubbed matroid [4]. Matroids are everywhere, if only we knew how to look. What led those junior-fellows to matroids? The same thing that will lead us: Ma-troids arise from shared behaviors of vector spaces and graphs. We explore this natural motivation for the matroid through two examples and consider how properties of in-dependence surface. We first consider the two matroids arising from these examples, and later introduce three more that are probably less familiar. Delving deeper, we can find matroids in arrangements of hyperplanes, configurations of points, and geometric lattices, if your tastes run in that direction. While tying together similar structures is important and enlightening, matroids do not reside merely in the halls of pure mathematics; they play an essential role in combinatorial optimization, and we consider their role in two contexts, constructing minimum-weight spanning trees and determining optimal schedules. What's that, you say? Minimum-weight what? The mathematical details will be-come clear later, but suppose you move your company into a new office building and your 25 employees need to connect their 25 computers to each other in a network. The cable needed to do this is expensive, so you want to connect them with the least cable possible; this will form a minimum-weight spanning tree, where by weight we mean the length of cable needed to connect the computers, by spanning we mean that we reach each computer, and by tree we mean we have no redundancy in the network. How do we find this minimum length? Test all possible networks for the minimum total cost? That would be 25 23 ≈ 1.4 × 10 32 networks to consider. (There are n n−2 possible trees on n vertices; Bogart [2] gives details.) A computer checking one billion configurations per second would take over a quadrillion years to complete the task. (That's 10 15 years—a very long time.) Matroids provide a more efficient method. VOL. 82, NO. 1, FEBRUARY 2009 27 Not only are matroids useful in these optimization settings, it turns out that they are the very characterizations of the problems. Recognizing that a problem involves a matroid tells us whether certain algorithms will return an optimal solution. Knowing that an algorithm effects a solution tells us whether we have a matroid. In the undergraduate curriculum, notions of independence arise in various contexts, yet are often not tied together. Matroids surface naturally in these situations. We pro-vide a brief, accessible introduction so that matroids can be included in undergraduate courses, and so that students (or faculty!) interested in matroids have a place to start. For further study of matroids, please see Oxley's Matroid Theory [9], especially its 61-page chapter, Brief Definitions and Examples. Only a cursory knowledge of linear algebra and graph theory is assumed, so take out your pencil and work along.},

In reality, many real-world networks interact with other networks. Here we develop an analytical framework for studying interacting networks and present an exact percolation law for a network of $n$ interdependent networks. In particular, we find that for $n$ Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi networks each of average degree $k$, the giant component, $P_{\infty}$, is given by $P_{\infty}=p[1-\exp(-kP_{\infty})]^n$ where $1-p$ is the initial fraction of removed nodes. Our general result coincides for $n=1$ with the known Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi second-order phase transition for a single network. For any $n \geq 2$ cascading failures occur and the transition becomes a first-order percolation transition. The new law for $P_{\infty}$ shows that percolation theory that is extensively studied in physics and mathematics is a limiting case ($n=1$) of a more general general and different percolation law for interdependent networks.},

With a back-off strategy in the SGD step and an elitist strategy in the evolution step, it guarantees that the best fitness in the population will never degrade. In addition, individuals in the population optimized with various SGD-based optimizers using distinct hyper-parameters in the SGD step are considered as competing species in a coevolution setting such that the complementarity of the optimizers is also taken into account.

We analyze three cases: 1) directed networks with fixed topology; 2) directed networks with switching topology; and 3) undirected networks with communication time-delays and fixed topology. We introduce two consensus protocols for networks with and without time-delays and provide a convergence analysis in all three cases. We establish a direct connection between the algebraic connectivity (or Fiedler eigenvalue) of the network and the performance (or negotiation speed) of a linear consensus protocol. This required the generalization of the notion of algebraic connectivity of undirected graphs to digraphs. It turns out that balanced digraphs play a key role in addressing average-consensus problems. We introduce disagreement functions for convergence analysis of consensus protocols. A disagreement function is a Lyapunov function for the disagreement network dynamics. We proposed a simple disagreement function that is a common Lyapunov function for the disagreement dynamics of a directed network with switching topology. A distinctive feature of this work is to address consensus problems for networks with directed information flow. We provide analytical tools that rely on algebraic graph theory, matrix theory, and control theory. Simulations are provided that demonstrate the effectiveness of our theoretical results.},

Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA.

This motivates us to study the optimal coupon allocation problem, and our objective is to allocate coupons to a set of users so as to maximize the expected cascade. Different from existing studies on influence maximizaton (IM), our framework allows a general utility function and a more complex set of constraints. In particular, we formulate our problem as an approximate submodular maximization problem subject to matroid and knapsack constraints. Existing techniques relying on the submodularity of the utility function, such as greedy algorithm, can not work directly on a non-submodular function. We use $\epsilon$ to measure the difference between our function and its closest submodular function and propose a novel approximate algorithm with approximation ratio $\beta(\epsilon)$ with $\lim_{\epsilon\rightarrow 0}\beta(\epsilon)=1-1/e$.

This family of optimization problems has several applications in machine learning, economics, and communication systems. Our main result is the first $\frac{1}{2}$-approximation algorithm for continuous submodular function maximization; this approximation factor of $\frac{1}{2}$ is the best possible for algorithms that only query the objective function at polynomially many points. For the special case of DR-submodular maximization, i.e. when the submodular functions is also coordinate wise concave along all coordinates, we provide a different $\frac{1}{2}$-approximation algorithm that runs in quasilinear time. Both of these results improve upon prior work [Bian et al, 2017, Soma and Yoshida, 2017]. Our first algorithm uses novel ideas such as reducing the guaranteed approximation problem to analyzing a zero-sum game for each coordinate, and incorporates the geometry of this zero-sum game to fix the value at this coordinate. Our second algorithm exploits coordinate-wise concavity to identify a monotone equilibrium condition sufficient for getting the required approximation guarantee, and hunts for the equilibrium point using binary search. We further run experiments to verify the performance of our proposed algorithms in related machine learning applications.},

Existing approximation ratios for the greedy algorithm assume a value oracle to the benefit function. However, access to a value oracle is not a realistic assumption for many applications of this problem, where the benefit function is difficult to compute. We present two incomparable approximation ratios for this problem with an approximate value oracle and demonstrate that the ratios take on empirically relevant values through a case study with the Influence Threshold problem in online social networks.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a novel framework for computing single or multiple atlases (templates) from a large population of images. Unlike many existing methods, our proposed approach is distinguished by its emphasis on the sharpness of the computed atlases and the requirement of rotational invariance. In particular, we argue that sharp atlas images that retain crucial and important anatomical features with high fidelity are more useful for many medical imaging applications when compared with the blurry and fuzzy atlas images computed by most existing methods. The geometric notion that underlies our approach is the idea of manifold learning in a quotient space, the quotient space of the image space by the rotations. We present an extension of the existing manifold learning approach to quotient spaces by using invariant metrics, and utilizing the manifold structure for partitioning the images into more homogeneous sub-collections, each of which can be represented by a single atlas image. Specifically, we propose a three-step algorithm. First, we partition the input images into subgroups using unsupervised or semi-supervised learning methods on manifolds. Then we formulate a convex optimization problem in each subgroup to locate the atlases and determine the crucial neighbors that are used in the realization step to form the template images. We have evaluated our algorithm using whole brain MR volumes from OASIS database. Experimental results demonstrate that the atlases computed using the proposed algorithm not only discover the brain structural changes in different age groups but also preserve important structural details and generally enjoy better image quality.},

Transportation and mobility networks, Internet, mobile phone networks, power grids, social and contact networks, and neural networks, are all examples where space is relevant and where topology alone does not contain all the information. Characterizing and understanding the structure and the evolution of spatial networks is thus crucial for many different fields, ranging from urbanism to epidemiology. An important consequence of space on networks is that there is a cost associated with the length of edges which in turn has dramatic effects on the topological structure of these networks. We will thoroughly explain the current state of our understanding of how the spatial constraints affect the structure and properties of these networks. We will review the most recent empirical observations and the most important models of spatial networks. We will also discuss various processes which take place on these spatial networks, such as phase transitions, random walks, synchronization, navigation, resilience, and disease spread. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Propagation of contagion through networks is a fundamental process. It is used to model the spread of information, influence, or a viral infection. Diffusion patterns can be specified by a probabilistic model, such as Independent Cascade (IC), or captured by a set of representative traces. Basic computational problems in the study of diffusion are influence queries (determining the potency of a specified seed set of nodes) and Influence Maximization (identifying the most influential seed set of a given size). Answering each influence query involves many edge traversals, and does not scale when there are many queries on very large graphs. The gold standard for Influence Maximization is the greedy algorithm, which iteratively adds to the seed set a node maximizing the marginal gain in influence. Greedy has a guaranteed approximation ratio of at least (1-1/e) and actually produces a sequence of nodes, with each prefix having approximation guarantee with respect to the same-size optimum. Since Greedy does not scale well beyond a few million edges, for larger inputs one must currently use either heuristics or alternative algorithms designed for a pre-specified small seed set size. We develop a novel sketch-based design for influence computation. Our greedy Sketch-based Influence Maximization (SKIM) algorithm scales to graphs with billions of edges, with one to two orders of magnitude speedup over the best greedy methods. It still has a guaranteed approximation ratio, and in practice its quality nearly matches that of exact greedy. We also present influence oracles, which use linear-time preprocessing to generate a small sketch for each node, allowing the influence of any seed set to be quickly answered from the sketches of its nodes.},

Equivalently, how to best choose communities in social networks like Facebook to stop rumors from spreading? Immunization is an important problem in multiple different domains like epidemiology, public health, cyber security and social media. Additionally, clearly immunization at group scale (like schools and communities) is more realistic due to constraints in implementations and compliance (e.g., it is hard to ensure specific individuals take the adequate vaccine). Hence efficient algorithms for such a "group-based" problem can help public-health experts take more practical decisions. However most prior work has looked into individual-scale immunization. In this paper, we study the problem of controlling propagation at group scale. We formulate novel so-called Group Immunization problems for multiple natural settings (for both threshold and cascade-based contagion models under both node-level and edge-level interventions) and develop multiple efficient algorithms, including provably approximate solutions. Finally, we show the effectiveness of our methods via extensive experiments on real and synthetic datasets.},

In particular, we explicitly model the temporal nature of influence between documents and re-interpret summarization as a coverage problem over words anchored in time. The resulting models provide monotone sub-modular objectives for computing informative and non-redundant summaries over time, which can be efficiently optimized with greedy algorithms.

For instance, our objective may be to cluster the graph in order to detect meaningful communities (or solve other common graph optimization problems such as facility location, maxcut, and so on). However, graphs or related attributes are often only partially observed, introducing learning problems such as link prediction which must be solved prior to optimization. Standard approaches treat learning and optimization entirely separately, while recent machine learning work aims to predict the optimal solution directly from the inputs. Here, we propose an alternative decision-focused learning approach that integrates a differentiable proxy for common graph optimization problems as a layer in learned systems. The main idea is to learn a representation that maps the original optimization problem onto a simpler proxy problem that can be efficiently differentiated through. Experimental results show that our ClusterNet system outperforms both pure end-to-end approaches (that directly predict the optimal solution) and standard approaches that entirely separate learning and optimization.

abstract = {There has been much progress recently on improved approximations for problems involving submodular objective functions, and many interesting techniques have been developed. However, the resulting algorithms are often slow and impractical. In this paper we develop algorithms that match the best known approximation guarantees, but with significantly improved running times, for maximizing a monotone submodular function f: 2[n] → R+ subject to various constraints. As in previous work, we measure the number of oracle calls to the objective function which is the dominating term in the running time. Our first result is a simple algorithm that gives a (1--1/e -- $\epsilon$)-approximation for a cardinality constraint using O(n/$\epsilon$ log n/$\epsilon$) queries, and a 1/(p + 2ℓ + 1 + $\epsilon$)-approximation for the intersection of a p-system and ℓ knapsack (linear) constraints using O (n/$\epsilon$2 log2 n/$\epsilon$) queries. This is the first approximation for a p-system combined with linear constraints. (We also show that the factor of p cannot be improved for maximizing over a p-system.) The main idea behind these algorithms serves as a building block in our more sophisticated algorithms. Our main result is a new variant of the continuous greedy algorithm, which interpolates between the classical greedy algorithm and a truly continuous algorithm. We show how this algorithm can be implemented for matroid and knapsack constraints using {\~{O}}(n2) oracle calls to the objective function. (Previous variants and alternative techniques were known to use at least {\~{O}}(n4) oracle calls.) This leads to an O(n2/$\epsilon$4 log2 n/$\epsilon$)-time (1--1/e -- $\epsilon$)-approximation for a matroid constraint. For a knapsack constraint, we develop a more involved (1--1/e -- $\epsilon$)-approximation algorithm that runs in time O(n2(1/$\epsilon$ log n)poly(1/$\epsilon$)).},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The spreading of behavior, such as the adoption of a new innovation, is influenced by the structure of social networks that interconnect the population. In the experiments of Centola [15], adoption of new behavior was shown to spread further and faster across clustered-lattice networks than across corresponding random networks. This implies that the “complex contagion” effects of social reinforcement are important in such diffusion, in contrast to “simple” contagion models of disease-spread which predict that epidemics would grow more efficiently on random networks than on clustered networks. To accurately model complex contagion on clustered networks remains a challenge because the usual assumptions (e.g., of mean-field theory) regarding tree-like networks are invalidated by the presence of triangles in the network; the triangles are, however, crucial to the social reinforcement mechanism, which posits an increased probability of a person adopting behavior that has been adopted by two or more neighbors. In this paper we modify the analytical approach that was introduced by H{\'{e}}bert-Dufresne et al. [19], to study disease-spread on clustered networks. We show how the approximation method can be adapted to a complex contagion model, and confirm the accuracy of the method with numerical simulations. The analytical results of the model enable us to quantify the level of social reinforcement that is required to observe—as in Centola's experiments—faster diffusion on clustered topologies than on random networks.},

Our first compressed data structure retrieves the occ occurrences of a pattern P[1, p] within a text T [1, n] in O(p + occ log 1+ n) time for any chosen , 0 < < < 1. This data structure uses at most 5n H k (T) + o(n) bits of storage, where H k (T) is the kth order empirical entropy of T . The space usage is (n) bits in the worst case and o(n) bits for compressible texts. This data structure exploits the relationship between suffix arrays and the Burrows–Wheeler Transform, and can be regarded as a compressed suffix array. Our second compressed data structure achieves O(p + occ) query time using O(n H k (T) log n) + o(n) bits of storage for any chosen , 0 < < < 1. Therefore, it provides optimal output-sensitive query time using o(n log n) bits in the worst case.

abstract = {Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are an important class of neural networks designed to retain and incorporate context into current decisions. RNNs are particularly well suited for machine learning problems in which context is important, such as speech recognition or language translation. This work presents RNNFast, a hardware accelerator for RNNs that leverages an emerging class of non-volatile memory called domain-wall memory (DWM). We show that DWM is very well suited for RNN acceleration due to its very high density and low read/write energy. At the same time, the sequential nature of input/weight processing of RNNs mitigates one of the downsides of DWM, which is the linear (rather than constant) data access time. RNNFast is very efficient and highly scalable, with flexible mapping of logical neurons to RNN hardware blocks. The basic hardware primitive, the RNN processing element (PE) includes custom DWM-based multiplication, sigmoid and tanh units for high density and low-energy. The accelerator is designed to minimize data movement by closely interleaving DWM storage and computation. We compare our design with a state-of-the-art GPGPU and find 21.8x better performance with 70x lower energy.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2014 IEEE. Many complex systems, from World Wide Web and online social networks to mobile networks, exhibit community structure in which nodes can be grouped into densely interconnected communities. This special structure has been exploited extensively to design better solutions for many operations and applications such as routing in wireless networks, worm containment and interest prediction in social networks. The outcome of these solutions are sensitive to the network structures, which raises an important question: can communities be broken easily in a network? To answer this question, we introduce a density-based problem formulation for analyzing the vulnerability of communities. Our approach includes the NP-completeness and a O(log k) approximation algorithm for solving the problem where k is the number of communities to be broken. Additionally, we analyze the vulnerability of communities in the context of arbitrary community detection algorithms. The empirical results show that communities are vulnerable to edge removal and in some cases the removal of a small fraction of edges can break the community structure.},

abstract = {Rate variation among the sites of a molecular sequence is commonly found in applications of phylogenetic inference. Several approaches exist to account for this feature but they do not usually enable us to pinpoint the sites that evolve under one or another rate of evolution in a straightforward manner. In this paper we concentrate on phylogenetic mixture models as tools for site classification. Our method does not rely on prior knowledge of site membership to classes or even the number of classes. Furthermore, it does not require correlated sites to be next to one another in the sequence alignment, unlike some phylogenetic hidden Markov or change-point models. We present a simulation study to show that our approach is able to correctly classify the sites to evolutionary classes and we analyse the popular alignment of the mitochondrial DNA of primates. In both examples, all mixtures outperform commonly-used models of among-site rate variation and models that do not account for rate heterogeneity. Our method for site classification is directly relevant to the profiling of genes with unknown function, and its application may lead to the discovery of partitions not otherwise recognised in the alignment. In addition, we discuss computational aspects including the use of simple Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) moves to estimate phylogenetic models and argue that these move types can mix efficiently without tempering the MCMC chains.},

abstract = {In the Submodular Welfare Problem, m items are to be distributed among n players with utility functions wi: 2[m] → R+. The utility functions are assumed to be monotone and submodular. Assuming that player i receives a set of items Si, we wish to maximize the total utility \Sigmai=1n wi(Si). In this paper, we work in the value oracle model where the only access to the utility functions is through a black box returning wi(S) for a given set S. Submodular Welfare is in fact a special case of the more general problem of submodular maximization subject to a matroid constraint: maxf(S): S ∈ I, where f is monotone submodular and I is the collection of independent sets in some matroid. For both problems, a greedy algorithm is known to yield a 1/2-approximation [21, 16]. In special cases where the matroid is uniform (I = S: \textbarS\textbar ≤ k) [20] or the submodular function is of a special type [4, 2], a (1-1/e)-approximation has been achieved and this is optimal for these problems in the value oracle model [22, 6, 15]. A (1-1/e)-approximation for the general Submodular Welfare Problem has been known only in a stronger demand oracle model [4], where in fact 1-1/e can be improved [9]. In this paper, we develop a randomized continuous greedy algorithm which achieves a (1-1/e)-approximation for the Submodular Welfare Problem in the value oracle model. We also show that the special case of n equal players is approximation resistant, in the sense that the optimal (1-1/e)-approximation is achieved by a uniformly random solution. Using the pipage rounding technique [1, 2], we obtain a (1-1/e)-approximation for submodular maximization subject to any matroid constraint. The continuous greedy algorithm has a potential of wider applicability, which we demonstrate on the examples of the Generalized Assignment Problem and the AdWords Assignment Problem.},

Using the core algorithm we build variants that compute node-cuts and are independent of s and t. Using the Pareto-set we can identify cuts with a particularly good trade-off that can be used to compute contraction and minimum fill-in orders. Our core algorithm has a running time in O(cm) where m is the number of edges and c the cut size. This makes it well-suited for large graphs with very small cuts, such as road graphs, which are our primary application.},

abstract = {The design of good heuristics or approximation algorithms for NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems often requires significant specialized knowledge and trial-and-error. Can we automate this challenging, tedious process, and learn the algorithms instead? In many real-world applications, it is typically the case that the same optimization problem is solved again and again on a regular basis, maintaining the same problem structure but differing in the data. This provides an opportunity for learning heuristic algorithms that exploit the structure of such recurring problems. In this paper, we propose a unique combination of reinforcement learning and graph embedding to address this challenge. The learned greedy policy behaves like a meta-algorithm that incrementally constructs a solution, and the action is determined by the output of a graph embedding network capturing the current state of the solution. We show that our framework can be applied to a diverse range of optimization problems over graphs, and learns effective algorithms for the Minimum Vertex Cover, Maximum Cut and Traveling Salesman problems.},

However, leveraging the vast amount of currently available gene expression data has the potential to facilitate our understanding of plant gene functions, especially in determining complex traits. Gene coexpression networks—created by integrating multiple expression datasets—connect genes with similar patterns of expression across multiple conditions. Dense gene communities in such networks, commonly referred to as modules, often indicate that the member genes are functionally related. As such, these modules serve as tools for generating new testable hypotheses, including the prediction of gene function and importance. Recently, we have seen a paradigm shift from the traditional “global” to more defined, context-specific coexpression networks. Such coexpression networks imply genetic correlations in specific biological contexts such as during development or in response to a stress. In this short review, we highlight a few recent studies that attempt to fill the large gaps in our knowledge about cellular functions of plant genes using context-specific coexpression networks.},

abstract = {Indexing highly repetitive texts --- such as genomic databases, software repositories and versioned text collections --- has become an important problem since the turn of the millennium. A relevant compressibility measure for repetitive texts is $r$, the number of runs in their Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT). One of the earliest indexes for repetitive collections, the Run-Length FM-index, used $O(r)$ space and was able to efficiently count the number of occurrences of a pattern of length $m$ in the text (in loglogarithmic time per pattern symbol, with current techniques). However, it was unable to locate the positions of those occurrences efficiently within a space bounded in terms of $r$. Since then, a number of other indexes with space bounded by other measures of repetitiveness --- the number of phrases in the Lempel-Ziv parse, the size of the smallest grammar generating the text, the size of the smallest automaton recognizing the text factors --- have been proposed for efficiently locating, but not directly counting, the occurrences of a pattern. In this paper we close this long-standing problem, showing how to extend the Run-Length FM-index so that it can locate the $occ$ occurrences efficiently within $O(r)$ space (in loglogarithmic time each), and reaching optimal time $O(m+occ)$ within $O(r\log(n/r))$ space, on a RAM machine of $w=\Omega(\log n)$ bits. Within $O(r\log (n/r))$ space, our index can also count in optimal time $O(m)$. Raising the space to $O(r w\log_\sigma(n/r))$, we support count and locate in $O(m\log(\sigma)/w)$ and $O(m\log(\sigma)/w+occ)$ time, which is optimal in the packed setting and had not been obtained before in compressed space. We also describe a structure using $O(r\log(n/r))$ space that replaces the text and extracts any text substring of length $\ell$ in almost-optimal time $O(\log(n/r)+\ell\log(\sigma)/w)$.

This setting arises, e.g., in recom-mender systems, where the utility of a subset of items may depend on a user-specific submodu-lar utility function. In modern applications, the ground set of items is often so large that even the widely used (lazy) greedy algorithm is not efficient enough. As a remedy, we introduce the problem of sublinear time probabilistic submod-ular maximization: Given training examples of functions (e.g., via user feature vectors), we seek to reduce the ground set so that optimizing new functions drawn from the same distribution will provide almost as much value when restricted to the reduced ground set as when using the full set. We cast this problem as a two-stage sub-modular maximization and develop a novel efficient algorithm for this problem which offers a 1 2 (1 − 1 e 2) approximation ratio for general monotone submodular functions and general matroid constraints. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on several real-world applications where running the maximization problem on the reduced ground set leads to two orders of magnitude speed-up while incurring almost no loss.},

abstract = {Transcriptional regulation is a fundamental molecular mechanism involved in almost every aspect of life, from homeostasis to development, from metabolism to behavior, from reaction to stimuli to disease progression. In recent years, the concept of Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) has grown popular as an effective applied biology approach for describing the complex and highly dynamic set of transcriptional interactions, due to its easy-to-interpret features. Since cataloguing, predicting and understanding every GRN connection in all species and cellular contexts remains a great challenge for biology, researchers have developed numerous tools and methods to infer regulatory processes. In this review, we catalogue these methods in six major areas, based on the dominant underlying information leveraged to infer GRNs: Coexpression, Sequence Motifs, Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP), Orthology, Literature and Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) specifically focused on transcriptional complexes. The methods described here cover a wide range of user-friendliness: from web tools that require no prior computational expertise to command line programs and algorithms for large scale GRN inferences. Each method for GRN inference described herein effectively illustrates a type of transcriptional relationship, with many methods being complementary to others. While a truly holistic approach for inferring and displaying GRNs remains one of the greatest challenges in the field of systems biology, we believe that the integration of multiple methods described herein provides an effective means with which experimental and computational biologists alike may obtain the most complete pictures of transcriptional relationships.

Recently, motivated by the design of viral marketing strategies, Domingos and Richardson posed a fundamental algorithmic problem for such social network processes: if we can try to convince a subset of individuals to adopt a new product or innovation, and the goal is to trigger a large cascade of further adoptions, which set of individuals should we target? We consider this problem in several of the most widely studied models in social network analysis. The optimization problem of selecting the most influential nodes is NP-hard here, and we provide the first provable approximation guarantees for efficient algorithms. Using an analysis framework based on submodular functions, we show that a natural greedy strategy obtains a solution that is provably within 63% of optimal for several classes of models; our framework suggests a general approach for reasoning about the performance guarantees of algorithms for these types of influence problems in social networks. We also provide computational experiments on large collaboration networks, showing that in addition to their provable guarantees, our approximation algorithms significantly out-perform nodeselection heuristics based on the well-studied notions of degree centrality and distance centrality from the field of social networks.},

abstract = {Recent studies have emphasized the merits of search processes that lack overarching objectives, instead promoting divergence by rewarding behavioral novelty. While this less objective search paradigm is more open-ended and divergent, it still diiers sig-niicantly from nature's mechanism of divergence. Rather than measuring novelty explicitly, nature is guided by a single, funda-mental constraint: survive long enough to reproduce. Surprisingly, this simple constraint produces both complexity and diversity in a continual process unparalleled by any algorithm to date. Inspired by the relative simplicity of open-endedness in nature in compar-ison to recent non-objective algorithms, this paper investigates the extent to which interactions between two coevolving popula-tions, both subject to their own constraint, or minimal criterion, can produce results that are both functional and diverse even without any behavior characterization or novelty archive. To test this new approach, a novel maze navigation domain is introduced wherein evolved agents must learn to navigate mazes whose structures are simultaneously coevolving and increasing in complexity. result is a broad range of maze topologies and successful agent trajectories in a single run, thereby suggesting the viability of minimal criterion coevolution as a new approach to non-objective search and a step towards genuinely open-ended algorithms.},

Recent algorithms have comparable guarantees in terms of asymptotic worst case analysis, but their actual number of rounds and query complexity depend on very large constants and polynomials in terms of precision and confidence, making them impractical for large data sets. Our main contribution is a design that is extremely efficient both in terms of its non-asymptotic worst case query complexity and number of rounds, and in terms of its practical runtime. We show that this algorithm outperforms any algorithm for submodular maximization we are aware of, including hyper-optimized parallel versions of state-of-the-art serial algorithms, by running experiments on large data sets. These experiments show FAST is orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art.},

abstract = {Many problems in machine learning involve calculating correspondences between sets of objects, such as point clouds or images. Discrete optimal transport provides a natural and successful approach to such tasks whenever the two sets of objects can be represented in the same space, or at least distances between them can be directly evaluated. Unfortunately neither requirement is likely to hold when object representations are learned from data. Indeed, automatically derived representations such as word embeddings are typically fixed only up to some global transformations, for example, reflection or rotation. As a result, pairwise distances across two such instances are ill-defined without specifying their relative transformation. In this work, we propose a general framework for optimal transport in the presence of latent global transformations. We cast the problem as a joint optimization over transport couplings and transformations chosen from a flexible class of invariances, propose algorithms to solve it, and show promising results in various tasks, including a popular unsupervised word translation benchmark.},

For example, most of the publicly available data from online social networking services (such as Facebook and Twiier) are collected via apps, users who make their accounts public, and/or the resources available to the researcher/practitioner. Such incompleteness can lead to inaccurate ndings. We introduce the Adaptive Edge Probing problem. Suppose that one has observed a networked phenomenon via some form of sampling and has a budget to enhance the incomplete network by asking for additional information about speciic nodes, with the ultimate goal of obtaining the most valuable information about the network as a whole. Which nodes should be further explored? We present ϵ-WGX, a network-based explore-exploit algorithm for identifying which nodes in the incomplete network to probe. Aggregated over multiple datasets and a wide range of probing budgets, we end that ϵ-WGX outperforms other explore-exploit strategies and baseline probing strategies. For example, for the task of adding as many nodes as possible, over incomplete networks observed via four popular sampling methods, ϵ-WGX outperforms the best comparison strategy by 12%-23% on average.},

We investigate these issues, with an emphasis on time to convergence and total computational cost, through an extensive empirical analysis of network training across several architectures and problem domains, including image classification, image segmentation, and language modeling. Although it is common practice to increase the batch size in order to fully exploit available computational resources, we find a substantially more nuanced picture. Our main finding is that across a wide range of network architectures and problem domains, increasing the batch size beyond a certain point yields no decrease in wall-clock time to convergence for \emph{either} train or test loss. This batch size is usually substantially below the capacity of current systems. We show that popular training strategies for large batch size optimization begin to fail before we can populate all available compute resources, and we show that the point at which these methods break down depends more on attributes like model architecture and data complexity than it does directly on the size of the dataset.},

abstract = {Low-rank representation (LRR) is an effective method for subspace clustering and has found wide applications in computer vision and machine learning. The existing LRR solver is based on the alternating direction method (ADM). It suffers from $O(n^3)$ computation complexity due to the matrix-matrix multiplications and matrix inversions, even if partial SVD is used. Moreover, introducing auxiliary variables also slows down the convergence. Such a heavy computation load prevents LRR from large scale applications. In this paper, we generalize ADM by linearizing the quadratic penalty term and allowing the penalty to change adaptively. We also propose a novel rule to update the penalty such that the convergence is fast. With our linearized ADM with adaptive penalty (LADMAP) method, it is unnecessary to introduce auxiliary variables and invert matrices. The matrix-matrix multiplications are further alleviated by using the skinny SVD representation technique. As a result, we arrive at an algorithm for LRR with complexity $O(rn^2)$, where $r$ is the rank of the representation matrix. Numerical experiments verify that for LRR our LADMAP method is much faster than state-of-the-art algorithms. Although we only present the results on LRR, LADMAP actually can be applied to solving more general convex programs.},

Betweenness is, in some sense, a measure of the influence a node has over the spread of information through the network. By counting only shortest paths, however, the conventional definition implicitly assumes that information spreads only along those shortest paths. Here, we propose a betweenness measure that relaxes this assumption, including contributions from essentially all paths between nodes, not just the shortest, although it still gives more weight to short paths. The measure is based on random walks, counting how often a node is traversed by a random walk between two other nodes. We show how our measure can be calculated using matrix methods, and give some examples of its application to particular networks.},

To this end, we identify the Incremental Group-level Popularity Prediction (IGPP) problem, and propose a novel model IGP-P to address it. We first conduct preprocess on the target topic being predicted, so as to build the initial group-level popularity tensor. Then, we predict the group-level popularity incrementally by exploiting the incremental CP decomposition algorithm. To reduce the cumulative error by incremental prediction, we propose two strategies to restart the CP decomposition. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments in two real datasets. The results show significant improvements of the IGPP method over other works both in the prediction accuracy and the efficiency.

It is known from prior work that for every $\epsilon$ > 0 there exists a constant-time distributed algorithm that finds a (1+$\epsilon$)-approximation of a maximum matching on bounded-degree graphs. In this work, we show—somewhat surprisingly—that no sublogarithmic-time approximation scheme exists for the dual problem: there is a constant $\delta$ > 0 so that no randomised distributed algorithm with running time o(log n) can find a (1+$\delta$)-approximation of a minimum vertex cover on 2-coloured graphs of maximum degree 3. In fact, a simple application of the Linial–Saks (1993) decomposition demonstrates that this run-time lower bound is tight. Our lower-bound construction is simple and, to some extent, independent of previous techniques. Along the way we prove that a certain cut minimisation problem, which might be of independent interest, is hard to approximate locally on expander graphs.},

Using our techniques, we obtain the strongest known approximation guarantees for this problem, both in terms of the submodularity ratio and the smallest k-sparse eigenvalue of the covariance matrix. We further demonstrate the wide applicability of our techniques by analyzing greedy algorithms for the dictionary selection problem, and significantly improve the previously known guarantees.

Here we implement an integrated network interrogation approach, in which proteome and transcriptome datasets from infection of both viruses in human lung epithelial cells are utilized to predict regulatory genes involved in the host response. We take advantage of a novel "crowd-based" approach to identify and combine ranking metrics that isolate genes/proteins likely related to the pathogenicity of SARS-CoV and influenza virus. Subsequently, a multivariate regression model is used to compare predicted lung epithelial regulatory influences with data derived from other respiratory virus infection models.

abstract = {Many complex systems can be represented as networks consisting of distinct types of interactions, which can be categorized as links belonging to different layers. For example, a good description of the full protein-protein interactome requires, for some organisms, up to seven distinct network layers, accounting for different genetic and physical interactions, each containing thousands of protein-protein relationships. A fundamental open question is then how many layers are indeed necessary to accurately represent the structure of a multilayered complex system. Here we introduce a method based on quantum theory to reduce the number of layers to a minimum while maximizing the distinguishability between the multilayer network and the corresponding aggregated graph. We validate our approach on synthetic benchmarks and we show that the number of informative layers in some real multilayer networks of protein-genetic interactions, social, economical and transportation systems can be reduced by up to 75%.},

abstract = {This paper initiates the studies of parallel algorithms for core maintenance in dynamic graphs. The core number is a fundamental index reflecting the cohesiveness of a graph, which are widely used in large-scale graph analytics. The core maintenance problem requires to update the core numbers of vertices after a set of edges and vertices are inserted into or deleted from the graph. We investigate the parallelism in the core update process when multiple edges and vertices are inserted or deleted. Specifically, we discover a structure called superior edge set, the insertion or deletion of edges in which can be processed in parallel. Based on the structure of superior edge set, efficient parallel algorithms are then devised for incremental and decremental core maintenance respectively. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed algorithms are the first parallel ones for the fundamental core maintenance problem. The algorithms show a significant speedup in the processing time compared with previous results that sequentially handle edge and vertex insertions/deletions. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted on different types of real-world and synthetic datasets, and the results illustrate the efficiency, stability and scalability of the proposed algorithms.},

abstract = {Stochastic Boolean Function Evaluation is the problem of determining the value of a given Boolean function f on an unknown input x, when each bit of x_i of x can only be determined by paying an associated cost c_i. The assumption is that x is drawn from a given product distribution, and the goal is to minimize the expected cost. This problem has been studied in Operations Research, where it is known as "sequential testing" of Boolean functions. It has also been studied in learning theory in the context of learning with attribute costs. We consider the general problem of developing approximation algorithms for Stochastic Boolean Function Evaluation. We give a 3-approximation algorithm for evaluating Boolean linear threshold formulas. We also present an approximation algorithm for evaluating CDNF formulas (and decision trees) achieving a factor of O(log kd), where k is the number of terms in the DNF formula, and d is the number of clauses in the CNF formula. In addition, we present approximation algorithms for simultaneous evaluation of linear threshold functions, and for ranking of linear functions. Our function evaluation algorithms are based on reductions to the Stochastic Submodular Set Cover (SSSC) problem. This problem was introduced by Golovin and Krause. They presented an approximation algorithm for the problem, called Adaptive Greedy. Our main technical contribution is a new approximation algorithm for the SSSC problem, which we call Adaptive Dual Greedy. It is an extension of the Dual Greedy algorithm for Submodular Set Cover due to Fujito, which is a generalization of Hochbaum's algorithm for the classical Set Cover Problem. We also give a new bound on the approximation achieved by the Adaptive Greedy algorithm of Golovin and Krause.},

For general stochastic greedy algo-rithms, bounded approximation guarantees were obtained only for subset selection with monotone submodular objective functions, while real-world applications often involve non-monotone or non-submodular objective functions and can be subject to a more general constraint than a size constraint. This work proves their approximation guarantees in these cases, and thus largely extends the applicabil-ity of stochastic greedy algorithms.},

Many times the collected network data is incomplete with nodes and edges missing. Com- monly, only a part of the network can be observed and we would like to infer the unobserved part of the network. We address this issue by studying the Network Completion Problem: Given a network with missing nodes and edges, can we complete the missing part? We cast the problem in the Expectation Maximization (EM) framework where we use the observed part of the network to fit a model of network structure, and then we estimate the missing part of the network us- ing the model, re-estimate the parameters and so on. We combine the EM with the Kronecker graphs model and design a scalable Metropolized Gibbs sampling ap- proach that allows for the estimation of the model pa- rameters as well as the inference about missing nodes and edges of the network. Experiments on synthetic and several real-world networks show that our approach can effectively recover the network even when about half of the nodes in the network are missing. Our algorithm outperforms not only classical link-prediction approaches but also the state of the art Stochastic block modeling approach. Furthermore, our algorithm easily scales to networks with tens of thousands of nodes.},

We address the algorithmic problem of finding a set of k initial seed nodes in a network so that the expected size of the resulting cascade is maximized, under the standard independent cascade model of network diffusion. Runtime is a primary consideration for this problem due to the massive size of the relevant input networks. We provide a fast algorithm for the influence maximization problem, obtaining the near-optimal approximation factor of (1 - 1/e - epsilon), for any epsilon > 0, in time O((m+n)log(n) / epsilon^3). Our algorithm is runtime-optimal (up to a logarithmic factor) and substantially improves upon the previously best-known algorithms which run in time Omega(mnk POLY(1/epsilon)). Furthermore, our algorithm can be modified to allow early termination: if it is terminated after O(beta(m+n)log(n)) steps for some beta < 1 (which can depend on n), then it returns a solution with approximation factor O(beta). Finally, we show that this runtime is optimal (up to logarithmic factors) for any beta and fixed seed size k.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Predicting protein complexes from protein-protein interaction data is becoming a fundamental problem in computational biology. The identification and characterization of protein complexes implicated are crucial to the understanding of the molecular events under normal and abnormal physiological conditions. On the other hand, large datasets of experimentally detected protein-protein interactions were determined using High-throughput experimental techniques. However, experimental data is usually liable to contain a large number of spurious interactions. Therefore, it is essential to validate these interactions before exploiting them to predict protein complexes.\n\nRESULTS: In this paper, we propose a novel graph mining algorithm (PEWCC) to identify such protein complexes. Firstly, the algorithm assesses the reliability of the interaction data, then predicts protein complexes based on the concept of weighted clustering coefficient. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, the performance of PEWCC was compared to several methods. PEWCC was able to detect more matched complexes than any of the state-of-the-art methods with higher quality scores.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: The higher accuracy achieved by PEWCC in detecting protein complexes is a valid argument in favor of the proposed method.

abstract = {The problem of maximizing non-negative monotone submodular functions under a certain constraint has been intensively studied in the last decade. In this paper, we address the problem for functions defined over the integer lattice. Suppose that a non-negative monotone submodular function $f:\mathbb{Z}_+^n \to \mathbb{R}_+$ is given via an evaluation oracle. Furthermore, we assume that $f$ satisfies the diminishing return property, which is not an immediate consequence of the submodularity when the domain is the integer lattice. Then, we show (i) a $(1-1/e-\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm for a cardinality constraint with $\widetilde{O}(\frac{n}{\epsilon}\log \frac{r}{\epsilon})$ queries, where $r$ is the maximum cardinality of feasible solutions, (ii) a $(1-1/e-\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm for a polymatroid constraint with $\widetilde{O}(\frac{nr}{\epsilon^4}+n^6)$ queries, where $r$ is the rank of the polymatroid, and (iii) a $(1-1/e-\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm for a knapsack constraint with $\widetilde{O}(\frac{n^2}{\epsilon^{18}}\log \frac{1}{w})(\frac{1}{\epsilon})^{O(1/\epsilon^8)}$ queries, where $w$ is the minumum weight of elements. Our algorithms for polymatroid constraints and knapsack constraints first extend the domain of the objective function to the Euclidean space and then run the continuous greedy algorithm. We give two different kinds of continuous extensions, one is for knapsack constraints and the other is for polymatroid constraints, which might be of independent interest.},

In this note, we give a generic reduction from the DRsubmodular setting to the submodular setting.

Our theorem describes the convergence of an infinite array of variants of SGD, each of which is associated with a specific probability law governing the data selection rule used to form mini-batches. This is the first time such an analysis is performed, and most of our variants of SGD were never explicitly considered in the literature before. Our analysis relies on the recently introduced notion of expected smoothness and does not rely on a uniform bound on the variance of the stochastic gradients. By specializing our theorem to different mini-batching strategies, such as sampling with replacement and independent sampling, we derive exact expressions for the stepsize as a function of the mini-batch size. With this we can also determine the mini-batch size that optimizes the total complexity, and show explicitly that as the variance of the stochastic gradient evaluated at the minimum grows, so does the optimal mini-batch size. For zero variance, the optimal mini-batch size is one. Moreover, we prove insightful stepsize-switching rules which describe when one should switch from a constant to a decreasing stepsize regime.},

Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA.

Recent research in the broader field of representation learning has led to significant progress in automating prediction by learning the features themselves. However, present feature learning approaches are not expressive enough to capture the diversity of connectivity patterns observed in networks. Here we propose node2vec, an algorithmic framework for learning continuous feature representations for nodes in networks. In node2vec, we learn a mapping of nodes to a low-dimensional space of features that maximizes the likelihood of preserving network neighborhoods of nodes. We define a flexible notion of a node's network neighborhood and design a biased random walk procedure, which efficiently explores diverse neighborhoods. Our algorithm generalizes prior work which is based on rigid notions of network neighborhoods, and we argue that the added flexibility in exploring neighborhoods is the key to learning richer representations. We demonstrate the efficacy of node2vec over existing state-of the-art techniques on multi-label classification and link prediction in several real-world networks from diverse domains. Taken together, our work represents a new way for efficiently learning state of-the-art task-independent representations in complex networks.},

Ordinarily, the connection topology is assumed to be either completely regular or completely random. But many biological, technological and social networks lie somewhere between these two extremes. Here we explore simple models of networks that can be tuned through this middle ground: regular networks 'rewired' to introduce increasing amounts of disorder. We find that these systems can be highly clustered, like regular lattices, yet have small characteristic path lengths, like random graphs. We call them 'small-world' networks, by analogy with the small-world phenomenon(13,14) (popularly known as six degrees of separation(15)). The neural network of the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the power grid of the western United States, and the collaboration graph of film actors are shown to be small-world networks. Models of dynamical systems with small-world coupling display enhanced signal-propagation speed, computational power, and synchronizability. In particular, infectious diseases spread more easily in small-world networks than in regular lattices.},

Furthermore, we show that asynchronous actor-critic succeeds on a wide variety of continuous motor control problems as well as on a new task of navigating random 3D mazes using a visual input.},

abstract = {We consider stochastic gradient descent (SGD) for least-squares regression with potentially several passes over the data. While several passes have been widely reported to perform practically better in terms of predictive performance on unseen data, the existing theoretical analysis of SGD suggests that a single pass is statistically optimal. While this is true for low-dimensional easy problems, we show that for hard problems, multiple passes lead to statistically optimal predictions while single pass does not; we also show that in these hard models, the optimal number of passes over the data increases with sample size. In order to define the notion of hardness and show that our predictive performances are optimal, we consider potentially infinite-dimensional models and notions typically associated to kernel methods, namely, the decay of eigenvalues of the covariance matrix of the features and the complexity of the optimal predictor as measured through the covariance matrix. We illustrate our results on synthetic experiments with non-linear kernel methods and on a classical benchmark with a linear model.},

The valuations of such buyers are placed within a hierarchy of valuations that exhibit no complementarities, a hierarchy that includes also OR and XOR combinations of singleton valuations, and valuations satisfying the gross substitutes property. Those last valuations are shown to form a zero-measure subset of the submodular valuations that have positive measure. While we show that the allocation problem among submodular valuations is NP-hard, we present an efficient greedy 2-approximation algorithm for this case and generalize it to the case of limited complementarities. No such approximation algorithm exists in a setting allowing for arbitrary complementarities.

A subsequent modified bidirectional Dijkstra algorithm can then find a shortest path in a fraction of a millisecond, visiting only a few hundred nodes. This small search space makes it suitable to implement it on a mobile device. We present a mobile implementation that also handles changes in the road network, like traffic jams, and that allows instantaneous routing without noticeable delay for the user. Also, an algorithm to calculate large distance tables is currently the fastest if based on contraction hierarchies.},

abstract = {We study the problem of finding a maximum matching in a graph given by an input stream listing its edges in some arbitrary order, where the quantity to be maximized is given by a monotone submodular function on subsets of edges. This problem, which we call maximum submodular-function matching (MSM), is a natural generalization of maximum weight matching (MWM), which is in turn a generalization of maximum cardinality matching (MCM). We give two incomparable algorithms for this problem with space usage falling in the semi-streaming range---they store only $O(n)$ edges, using $O(n\log n)$ working memory---that achieve approximation ratios of $7.75$ in a single pass and $(3+\epsilon)$ in $O(\epsilon^{-3})$ passes respectively. The operations of these algorithms mimic those of Zelke's and McGregor's respective algorithms for MWM; the novelty lies in the analysis for the MSM setting. In fact we identify a general framework for MWM algorithms that allows this kind of adaptation to the broader setting of MSM. In the sequel, we give generalizations of these results where the maximization is over "independent sets" in a very general sense. This generalization captures hypermatchings in hypergraphs as well as independence in the intersection of multiple matroids.},

abstract = {This paper studies the problem of detecting the information source in a network in which the spread of information follows the popular Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model. We assume all nodes in the network are in the susceptible state initially except the information source which is in the infected state. Susceptible nodes may then be infected by infected nodes, and infected nodes may recover and will not be infected again after recovery. Given a snapshot of the network, from which we know all infected nodes but cannot distinguish susceptible nodes and recovered nodes, the problem is to find the information source based on the snapshot and the network topology. We develop a sample path based approach where the estimator of the information source is chosen to be the root node associated with the sample path that most likely leads to the observed snapshot. We prove for infinite-trees, the estimator is a node that minimizes the maximum distance to the infected nodes. A reverse-infection algorithm is proposed to find such an estimator in general graphs. We prove that for $g$-regular trees such that $gq>1,$ where $g$ is the node degree and $q$ is the infection probability, the estimator is within a constant distance from the actual source with a high probability, independent of the number of infected nodes and the time the snapshot is taken. Our simulation results show that for tree networks, the estimator produced by the reverse-infection algorithm is closer to the actual source than the one identified by the closeness centrality heuristic. We then further evaluate the performance of the reverse infection algorithm on several real world networks.},

abstract = {The de Bruijn graph $G_K$ of a set of strings $S$ is a key data structure in genome assembly that represents overlaps between all the $K$-length substrings of $S$. Construction and navigation of the graph is a space and time bottleneck in practice and the main hurdle for assembling large, eukaryote genomes. This problem is compounded by the fact that state-of-the-art assemblers do not build the de Bruijn graph for a single order (value of $K$) but for multiple values of $K$. More precisely, they build $d$ de Bruijn graphs, each with a specific order, i.e., $G_{K_1}, G_{K_2}, ..., G_{K_d}$. Although, this paradigm increases the quality of the assembly produced, it increases the memory by a factor of $d$ in most cases. In this paper, we show how to augment a succinct de Bruijn graph representation by Bowe et al. (Proc. WABI, 2012) to support new operations that let us change order on the fly, effectively representing all de Bruijn graphs of order up to some maximum $K$ in a single data structure. Our experiments show our variable-order de Bruijn graph only modestly increases space usage, construction time, and navigation time compared to a single order graph.},

abstract = {Betweenness centrality ranks the importance of nodes by their participation in all shortest paths of the network. Therefore computing exact betweenness values is impractical in large networks. For static networks, approximation based on randomly sampled paths has been shown to be significantly faster in practice. However, for dynamic networks, no approximation algorithm for betweenness centrality is known that improves on static recomputation. We address this deficit by proposing two incremental approximation algorithms (for weighted and unweighted connected graphs) which provide a provable guarantee on the absolute approximation error. Processing batches of edge insertions, our algorithms yield significant speedups up to a factor of $10^4$ compared to restarting the approximation. This is enabled by investing memory to store and efficiently update shortest paths. As a building block, we also propose an asymptotically faster algorithm for updating the SSSP problem in unweighted graphs. Our experimental study shows that our algorithms are the first to make in-memory computation of a betweenness ranking practical for million-edge semi-dynamic networks. Moreover, our results show that the accuracy is even better than the theoretical guarantees in terms of absolutes errors and the rank of nodes is well preserved, in particular for those with high betweenness.},

We prove that the MEO problem is NPhard and cannot be approximated within a constant ratio unless P=NP. (2) We propose a heuristic algorithm OSIM to efficiently solve the MEO problem. To better explain the OSIM heuristic, we first introduce EaSyIM – the opinionoblivious version of OSIM, a scalable algorithm capable of running within practical compute times on commodity hardware. In addition to serving as a fundamental building block for OSIM, EaSyIM is capable of addressing the scalability aspect – memory consumption and running time, of the IM problem as well. Empirically, our algorithms are capable of maintaining the deviation in the spread always within 5% of the best known methods in the literature. In addition, our experiments show that both OSIM and EaSyIM are effective, efficient, scalable and significantly enhance the ability to analyze real datasets.},

abstract = {In this paper we introduce a unified analysis of a large family of variants of proximal stochastic gradient descent ({\tt SGD}) which so far have required different intuitions, convergence analyses, have different applications, and which have been developed separately in various communities. We show that our framework includes methods with and without the following tricks, and their combinations: variance reduction, importance sampling, mini-batch sampling, quantization, and coordinate sub-sampling. As a by-product, we obtain the first unified theory of {\tt SGD} and randomized coordinate descent ({\tt RCD}) methods, the first unified theory of variance reduced and non-variance-reduced {\tt SGD} methods, and the first unified theory of quantized and non-quantized methods. A key to our approach is a parametric assumption on the iterates and stochastic gradients. In a single theorem we establish a linear convergence result under this assumption and strong-quasi convexity of the loss function. Whenever we recover an existing method as a special case, our theorem gives the best known complexity result. Our approach can be used to motivate the development of new useful methods, and offers pre-proved convergence guarantees. To illustrate the strength of our approach, we develop five new variants of {\tt SGD}, and through numerical experiments demonstrate some of their properties.},

abstract = {Indexing highly repetitive texts --- such as genomic databases, software repositories and versioned text collections --- has become an important problem since the turn of the millennium. A relevant compressibility measure for repetitive texts is $r$, the number of runs in their Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT). One of the earliest indexes for repetitive collections, the Run-Length FM-index, used $O(r)$ space and was able to efficiently count the number of occurrences of a pattern of length $m$ in the text (in loglogarithmic time per pattern symbol, with current techniques). However, it was unable to locate the positions of those occurrences efficiently within a space bounded in terms of $r$. Since then, a number of other indexes with space bounded by other measures of repetitiveness --- the number of phrases in the Lempel-Ziv parse, the size of the smallest grammar generating the text, the size of the smallest automaton recognizing the text factors --- have been proposed for efficiently locating, but not directly counting, the occurrences of a pattern. In this paper we close this long-standing problem, showing how to extend the Run-Length FM-index so that it can locate the $occ$ occurrences efficiently within $O(r)$ space (in loglogarithmic time each), and reaching optimal time $O(m+occ)$ within $O(r\log(n/r))$ space, on a RAM machine of $w=\Omega(\log n)$ bits. Within $O(r\log (n/r))$ space, our index can also count in optimal time $O(m)$. Raising the space to $O(r w\log_\sigma(n/r))$, we support count and locate in $O(m\log(\sigma)/w)$ and $O(m\log(\sigma)/w+occ)$ time, which is optimal in the packed setting and had not been obtained before in compressed space. We also describe a structure using $O(r\log(n/r))$ space that replaces the text and extracts any text substring of length $\ell$ in almost-optimal time $O(\log(n/r)+\ell\log(\sigma)/w)$.

abstract = {We consider power line outages in the transmission system of the power grid, and specifically those caused by a natural disaster or a large scale physical attack. In the transmission system, an outage of a line may lead to overload on other lines, thereby eventually leading to their outage. While such cascading failures have been studied before, our focus is on cascading failures that follow an outage of several lines in the same geographical area. We provide an analytical model of such failures, investigate the model's properties, and show that it differs from other models used to analyze cascades in the power grid (e.g., epidemic/percolation-based models). We then show how to identify the most vulnerable locations in the grid and perform extensive numerical experiments with real grid data to investigate the various effects of geographically correlated outages and the resulting cascades. These results allow us to gain insights into the relationships between various parameters and performance metrics, such as the size of the original event, the final number of connected components, and the fraction of demand (load) satisfied after the cascade. In particular, we focus on the timing and nature of optimal control actions used to reduce the impact of a cascade, in real time. We also compare results obtained by our model to the results of a real cascade that occurred during a major blackout in the San Diego area on Sept. 2011. The analysis and results presented in this paper will have implications both on the design of new power grids and on identifying the locations for shielding, strengthening, and monitoring efforts in grid upgrades.},

It is known that the greedy algorithm yields a 1/2-approximation [9] for this problem. It is also known, via a reduction from the max-k-cover problem, that there is no (1 {\"{i}}¾¿ 1/e+ {\"{i}}¾¿)-approximation for any constant {\"{i}}¾¿> 0, unless P= NP[6]. In this paper, we improve the 1/2-approximation to a (1 {\"{i}}¾¿ 1/e)-approximation, when fis a sum of weighted rank functions of matroids. This class of functions captures a number of interesting problems including set coverage type problems. Our main tools are the pipage rounding technique of Ageev and Sviridenko [1] and a probabilistic lemma on monotone submodular functions that might be of independent interest. We show that the generalized assignment problem (GAP) is a special case of our problem; although the reduction requires |N| to be exponential in the original problem size, we are able to interpret the recent (1 {\"{i}}¾¿ 1/e)-approximation for GAP by Fleischer et al.[10] in our framework. This enables us to obtain a (1 {\"{i}}¾¿ 1/e)-approximation for variants of GAP with more complex constraints.},

These issues arise because of the biased nature of the sign compression operator. We then show that using error-feedback, i.e. incorporating the error made by the compression operator into the next step, overcomes these issues. We prove that our algorithm EF-SGD achieves the same rate of convergence as SGD without any additional assumptions for arbitrary compression operators (including the sign operator), indicating that we get gradient compression for free. Our experiments thoroughly substantiate the theory showing the superiority of our algorithm.},

abstract = {Recent advances in the study of networked systems have highlighted that our interconnected world is composed of networks that are coupled to each other through different ‘layers' that each represent one of many possible subsystems or types of interactions. Nevertheless, it is traditional to aggregate multilayer networks into a single weighted network in order to take advantage of existing tools. This is admittedly convenient, but it is also extremely problematic, as important information can be lost as a result. It is therefore important to develop multilayer generalizations of network concepts. In this paper, we analyze triadic relations and generalize the idea of transitivity to multiplex networks. By focusing on triadic relations, which yield the simplest type of transitivity, we generalize the concept and computation of clustering coefficients to multiplex networks. We show how the layered structure of such networks introduces a new degree of freedom that has a fundamental effect on transitivity. We compute multiplex clustering coefficients for several real multiplex networks and illustrate why one must take great care when generalizing standard network concepts to multiplex networks. We also derive analytical expressions for our clustering coefficients for ensemble averages of networks in a family of random multiplex networks. Our analysis illustrates that social networks have a strong tendency to promote redundancy by closing triads at every layer and that they thereby have a different type of multiplex transitivity from transportation networks, which do not exhibit such a tendency. These insights are invisible if one only studies aggregated networks.},

We propose the first fully decentralized optimization method for a wide class of non-convex objective functions that possess a diminishing returns property. More specifically, given an arbitrary connected network and a global continuous submodular function, formed by a sum of local functions, we develop Decentralized Continuous Greedy (DCG), a message passing algorithm that converges to the tight (1-1/e) approximation factor of the optimum global solution using only local computation and communication. We also provide strong convergence bounds as a function of network size and spectral characteristics of the underlying topology. Interestingly, DCG readily provides a simple recipe for decentralized discrete submodular maximization through the means of continuous relaxations. Formally, we demonstrate that by lifting the local discrete functions to continuous domains and using DCG as an interface we can develop a consensus algorithm that also achieves the tight (1-1/e) approximation guarantee of the global discrete solution once a proper rounding scheme is applied.},

Recently, much attention has been devoted to the study of mutation operators with dynamic and non-uniform mutation rates. Following up on this line of work, we propose a new mutation operator and analyze its performance on the (1+1) Evolutionary Algorithm (EA). Our analyses show that this mutation operator competes with pre-existing ones, when used by the (1+1) EA on classes of problems for which results on the other mutation operators are available. We present a "jump" function for which the performance of the (1+1) EA using any static uniform mutation and any restart strategy can be worse than the performance of the (1+1) EA using our mutation operator with no restarts. We show that the (1+1) EA using our mutation operator finds a (1/3)-approximation ratio on any non-negative submodular function in polynomial time. This performance matches that of combinatorial local search algorithms specifically designed to solve this problem. Finally, we evaluate experimentally the performance of the (1+1) EA using our operator, on real-world graphs of different origins with up to 37,000 vertices and 1.6 million edges. In comparison with uniform mutation and a recently proposed dynamic scheme our operator comes out on top on these instances.},

abstract = {Plants are fascinating and complex organisms. A comprehensive understanding of the organization, function and evolution of plant genes is essential to disentangle important biological processes and to advance crop engineering and breeding strategies. The ultimate aim in deciphering complex biological processes is the discovery of causal genes and regulatory mechanisms controlling these processes. The recent surge of omics data has opened the door to a system-wide understanding of the flow of biological information underlying complex traits. However, dealing with the corresponding large data sets represents a challenging endeavor that calls for the development of powerful bioinformatics methods. A popular approach is the construction and analysis of gene networks. Such networks are often used for genome-wide representation of the complex functional organization of biological systems. Network based on similarity in gene expression are called (gene) co-expression networks. One of the major application of gene co-expression networks is the functional annotation of unknown genes. Constructing co-expression networks is generally straightforward. In contrast, the resulting network of connected genes can become very complex, which limits its biological interpretation. Several strategies can be employed to enhance the interpretation of the networks. A strategy in coherence with the biological question addressed needs to be established to infer reliable networks. Additional benefits can be gained from network-based strategies using prior knowledge and data integration to further enhance the elucidation of gene regulatory relationships. As a result, biological networks provide many more applications beyond the simple visualization of co-expressed genes. In this study we review the different approaches for co-expression network inference in plants. We analyse integrative genomics strategies used in recent studies that successfully identified candidate genes taking advantage of gene co-expression networks. Additionally, we discuss promising bioinformatics approaches that predict networks for specific purposes.},

abstract = {Primal and dual block coordinate descent methods are iterative methods for solving regularized and unregularized optimization problems. Distributed-memory parallel implementations of these methods have become popular in analyzing large machine learning datasets. However, existing implementations communicate at every iteration which, on modern data center and supercomputing architectures, often dominates the cost of floating-point computation. Recent results on communication-avoiding Krylov subspace methods suggest that large speedups are possible by re-organizing iterative algorithms to avoid communication. We show how applying similar algorithmic transformations can lead to primal and dual block coordinate descent methods that only communicate every $s$ iterations--where $s$ is a tuning parameter--instead of every iteration for the \textit{regularized least-squares problem}. We show that the communication-avoiding variants reduce the number of synchronizations by a factor of $s$ on distributed-memory parallel machines without altering the convergence rate and attains strong scaling speedups of up to $6.1\times$ on a Cray XC30 supercomputer.},

Given a tree of $n$ nodes, each with a label from $[1..\sigma]$, and a fixed threshold $0<\tau<1$, such a query gives two nodes $u$ and $v$ and asks for all the labels that appear more than $\tau \cdot |P_{uv}|$ times in the path $P_{uv}$ from $u$ to $v$. Note that the answer to any query is of size up to $1/\tau$. On a $w$-bit RAM machine, we obtain a linear-space data structure that lists all the majorities in time $O((1/\tau)\log^* n \log\log_w \sigma)$. For any $\kappa > 1$, we can also build a data structure that uses $O(n\log^{[\kappa]} n)$ space, where $\log^{[\kappa]} n$ is the iterated logarithm, and answers queries in time $O((1/\tau)\log\log_w \sigma)$. The construction time of both data structures is $O(n\log n)$. We also describe succinct-space solutions, both reaching the same query time of the linear-space structure. One uses $2nH + 4n + o(n)(H+1)$ bits, where $H \le \lg\sigma$ is the entropy of the distribution of labels in $T$, and can be built in $O(n\log n)$ time. The other uses $nH + O(n) + o(nH)$ bits and is built in $O(n\log n)$ randomized time.},

abstract = {The function of a real network depends not only on the reliability of its own components, but is affected also by the simultaneous operation of other real networks coupled with it. Robustness of systems composed of interdependent network layers has been extensively studied in recent years. However, the theoretical frameworks developed so far apply only to special models in the limit of infinite sizes. These methods are therefore of little help in practical contexts, given that real interconnected networks have finite size and their structures are generally not compatible with those of graph toy models. Here, we introduce a theoretical method that takes as inputs the adjacency matrices of the layers to draw the entire phase diagram for the interconnected network, without the need of actually simulating any percolation process. We demonstrate that percolation transitions in arbitrary interdependent networks can be understood by decomposing these system into uncoupled graphs: the intersection among the layers, and the remainders of the layers. When the intersection dominates the remainders, an interconnected network undergoes a continuous percolation transition. Conversely, if the intersection is dominated by the contribution of the remainders, the transition becomes abrupt even in systems of finite size. We provide examples of real systems that have developed interdependent networks sharing a core of "high quality" edges to prevent catastrophic failures.},

abstract = {We consider the problem of maintaining an approximately maximum (fractional) matching and an approximately minimum vertex cover in a dynamic graph. Starting with the seminal paper by Onak and Rubinfeld [STOC 2010], this problem has received significant attention in recent years. There remains, however, a polynomial gap between the best known worst case update time and the best known amortised update time for this problem, even after allowing for randomisation. Specifically, Bernstein and Stein [ICALP 2015, SODA 2016] have the best known worst case update time. They present a deterministic data structure with approximation ratio $(3/2+\epsilon)$ and worst case update time $O(m^{1/4}/\epsilon^2)$, where $m$ is the number of edges in the graph. In recent past, Gupta and Peng [FOCS 2013] gave a deterministic data structure with approximation ratio $(1+\epsilon)$ and worst case update time $O(\sqrt{m}/\epsilon^2)$. No known randomised data structure beats the worst case update times of these two results. In contrast, the paper by Onak and Rubinfeld [STOC 2010] gave a randomised data structure with approximation ratio $O(1)$ and amortised update time $O(\log^2 n)$, where $n$ is the number of nodes in the graph. This was later improved by Baswana, Gupta and Sen [FOCS 2011] and Solomon [FOCS 2016], leading to a randomised date structure with approximation ratio $2$ and amortised update time $O(1)$. We bridge the polynomial gap between the worst case and amortised update times for this problem, without using any randomisation. We present a deterministic data structure with approximation ratio $(2+\epsilon)$ and worst case update time $O(\log^3 n)$, for all sufficiently small constants $\epsilon$.},

In this paper, we present a bilevel formulation of the r-interdiction median problem with fortification (RIMF). RIMF identifies the most cost-effective way of allocating protective resources among the facilities of an existing but vulnerable system so that the impact of the most disruptive attack to r unprotected facilities is minimized. The model is based upon the classical p-median location model and assumes that the efficiency of the system is measured in terms of accessibility or service provision costs. In the bilevel formulation, the top level problem involves the decisions about which facilities to fortify in order to minimize the worst-case efficiency reduction due to the loss of unprotected facilities. Worst-case scenario losses are modeled in the lower-level interdiction problem. We solve the bilevel problem through an implicit enumeration (IE) algorithm, which relies on the efficient solution of the lower-level interdiction problem. Extensive computational results are reported, including comparisons with earlier results obtained by a single-level approach to the problem. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

In this paper we study node centrality for very large graphs, up to billions of nodes and edges. Various definitions for centrality have been proposed, ranging from very simple (e.g., node degree) to more elab- orate. However, measuring centrality in billion-scale graphs poses several challenges. Many of the traditional defini- tions such as closeness and betweenness were not designed with scalability in mind. Therefore, it is very difficult, if not impossible, to compute them both accurately and effi- ciently. In this paper, we propose centrality measures suit- able for very large graphs, as well as scalable methods to effectively compute them. More specifically, we propose effective closeness and LINERANK which are designed for billion-scale graphs. We also develop algorithms to compute the proposed centrality measures in MAPREDUCE, a mod- ern paradigm for large-scale, distributed data processing. We present extensive experimental results on both synthetic and real datasets, which demonstrate the scalability of our ap- proach to very large graphs, as well as interesting findings and anomalies.},

Furthermore, non-trivial trophic structures have been observed in networks of neurons, species, genes, metabolites, cellular signalling, concatenated words, P2P users, and world trade. Here we consider two simple yet apparently quite different dynamical models -- one a Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) epidemic model adapted to include complex contagion, the other an Amari-Hopfield neural network -- and show that in both cases the related spreading processes are modulated in similar ways by the trophic coherence of the underlying networks. To do this, we propose a network assembly model which can generate structures with tunable trophic coherence, limiting in either perfectly stratified networks or random graphs. We find that trophic coherence can exert a qualitative change in spreading behaviour, determining whether a pulse of activity will percolate through the entire network or remain confined to a subset of nodes, and whether such activity will quickly die out or endure indefinitely. These results could be important for our understanding of phenomena such as epidemics, rumours, shocks to ecosystems, neuronal avalanches, and many other spreading processes.},

abstract = {—This paper investigates the network completion problem, where it is assumed that only a small sample of a network (e.g., a complete or partially observed subgraph of a social graph) is observed and we would like to infer the unobserved part of the network. In this paper, we assume that besides the observed subgraph, side information about the nodes such as the pairwise similarity between them is also provided. In contrast to the original network completion problem where the standard methods such as matrix completion is inapplicable due the non-uniform sampling of observed links, we show that by effectively exploiting the side information, it is possible to accurately predict the unobserved links. In contrast to existing matrix completion methods with side information such as shared subsapce learning and matrix completion with transduction, the proposed algorithm decouples the completion from transduction to effectively exploit the similarity information. This crucial difference greatly boosts the performance when appropriate similarity information is used. The recovery error of the proposed algorithm is theoretically analyzed based on the richness of the similarity information and the size of the observed submatrix. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first algorithm that addresses the network completion with similarity of nodes with provable guarantees. Experiments on synthetic and real networks from Facebook and Google+ show that the proposed two-stage method is able to accurately reconstruct the network and outperforms other methods.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The prevalence of obesity has increased substantially over the past 30 years. We performed a quantitative analysis of the nature and extent of the person-to-person spread of obesity as a possible factor contributing to the obesity epidemic. METHODS: We evaluated a densely interconnected social network of 12,067 people assessed repeatedly from 1971 to 2003 as part of the Framingham Heart Study. The body-mass index was available for all subjects. We used longitudinal statistical models to examine whether weight gain in one person was associated with weight gain in his or her friends, siblings, spouse, and neighbors. RESULTS: Discernible clusters of obese persons (body-mass index [the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters], > or =30) were present in the network at all time points, and the clusters extended to three degrees of separation. These clusters did not appear to be solely attributable to the selective formation of social ties among obese persons. A person's chances of becoming obese increased by 57% (95% confidence interval [CI], 6 to 123) if he or she had a friend who became obese in a given interval. Among pairs of adult siblings, if one sibling became obese, the chance that the other would become obese increased by 40% (95% CI, 21 to 60). If one spouse became obese, the likelihood that the other spouse would become obese increased by 37% (95% CI, 7 to 73). These effects were not seen among neighbors in the immediate geographic location. Persons of the same sex had relatively greater influence on each other than those of the opposite sex. The spread of smoking cessation did not account for the spread of obesity in the network. CONCLUSIONS: Network phenomena appear to be relevant to the biologic and behavioral trait of obesity, and obesity appears to spread through social ties. These findings have implications for clinical and public health interventions.},

While influence maximization has been studied in this context (see Chapter 24 of [10]), we study revenue maximization, arguably, a more natural objective. In our model, a buyer's decision to buy an item is influenced by the set of other buyers that own the item and the price at which the item is offered. We focus on algorithmic question of finding revenue maximizing marketing strategies. When the buyers are completely symmetric, we can find the optimal marketing strategy in polynomial time. In the general case, motivated by hardness results, we investigate approximation algorithms for this problem. We identify a family of strategies called influence-and-exploit strategies that are based on the following idea: Initially influence the population by giving the item for free to carefully a chosen set of buyers. Then extract revenue from the remaining buyers using a 'greedy' pricing strategy. We first argue why such strategies are reasonable and then show how to use recently developed set-function maximization techniques to find the right set of buyers to influence.},

abstract = {We provide tight upper and lower bounds, up to a constant factor, for the number of inputs and outputs (I/OS) between internal memory and secondary storage required for five sorting-related problems: sorting, the fast Fourier transform (FFT), permutation networks, permuting, and matrix transposition. The bounds hold both in the worst case and in the average case, and in several situations the constant factors match. Secondary storage is modeled as a magnetic disk capable of transferring P blocks each containing B records in a single time unit; the records in each block must be input from or output to B contiguous locations on the disk. We give two optimal algorithms for the problems, which are variants of merge sorting and distribution sorting. In particular we show for P = 1 that the standard merge sorting algorithm is an optimal external sorting method, up to a constant factor in the number of I/Os. Our sorting algorithms use the same number of I/Os as does the permutation phase of key sorting, except when the internal memory size is extremely small, thus affirming the popular adage that key sorting is not faster. We also give a simpler and more direct derivation of Hong and Kung's lower bound for the FFT for the special case B = P = O(1). {\textcopyright} 1988, ACM. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {It is well known that different solution strategies work well for different types of instances of hard combinatorial problems. As a consequence, most solvers for the propositional satisfiability problem (SAT) expose parameters that allow them to be customized to a particular family of instances. In the international SAT competition series, these parameters are ignored: solvers are run using a single default parameter setting (supplied by the authors) for all benchmark instances in a given track. While this competition format rewards solvers with robust default settings, it does not reflect the situation faced by a practitioner who only cares about performance on one particular application and can invest some time into tuning solver parameters for this application. The new Configurable SAT Solver Competition (CSSC) compares solvers in this latter setting, scoring each solver by the performance it achieved after a fully automated configuration step. This article describes the CSSC in more detail, and reports the results obtained in its two instantiations so far, CSSC 2013 and 2014.},

[9] showed a 2/5-approximation for the unconstrained problem and also proved that no approximation better than 1/2 is possible in the value oracle model. Constant-factor approximation has been also known for subinodular maximization subject to a matroid independence constraint (a factor of 0.309 [33]) and for submodular maximization subject to a matroid base constraint, provided that the fractional base packing number $\nu$ is bounded away from 1 (a 1/4-approximation assuming that $\nu$ ≥ 2 [33]). In this paper, we propose a new algorithm for submodular maximization which is based on the idea of simulated annealing. We prove that this algorithm achieves improved approximation for two problems: a 0.41-approximation for unconstrained submodular maximization, and a 0.325-approximation for submodular maximization subject to a matroid independence constraint. On the hardness side, we show that in the value oracle model it is impossible to achieve a 0.478-approximation for submodular maximization subject to a matroid independence constraint, or a 0.394-approximation subject to a matroid base constraint in matroids with two disjoint bases. Even for the special case of cardinality constraint, we prove it is impossible to achieve a 0.491-approximation. (Previously it was conceivable that a 1/2-approximation exists for these problems.) It is still an open question whether a 1/2-approximation is possible for unconstrained submodular maximization.},

Specifically, given an undirected graph G, the objective of triangle listing is to find all the cliques involving 3 vertices in G. The problem has been well studied in internal memory, but remains an urgent difficult challenge when G does not fit in memory, rendering any algorithm to entail frequent I/O accesses. Although previous research has attempted to tackle the challenge, the state-of-the-art solutions rely on a set of crippling assumptions to guarantee good performance. Motivated by this, we develop a new algorithm that is provably I/O and CPU efficient at the same time, without making any assumption on the input G at all. The algorithm uses ideas drastically different from all the previous approaches, and outperformed the existing competitors by a factor over an order of magnitude in our extensive experimentation.},

Such process, originally studied on regular structures, has been recently investigated also in the context of random graphs, where it can serve as a simple model for a wide variety of cascades, such as the spreading of ideas, trends, viral contents, etc. over large social networks. In particular, it has been shown that in $G(n,p)$ the final active set can exhibit a phase transition for a sub-linear number of seeds. In this paper, we propose a unique framework to study similar sub-linear phase transitions for a much broader class of graph models and epidemic processes. Specifically, we consider i) a generalized version of bootstrap percolation in $G(n,p)$ with random activation thresholds and random node-to-node influences; ii) different random graph models, including graphs with given degree sequence and graphs with community structure (block model). The common thread of our work is to show the surprising sensitivity of the critical seed set size to extreme values of distributions, which makes some systems dramatically vulnerable to large-scale outbreaks.

abstract = {Protein structure prediction can be used to determine the three-dimensional shape of a protein from its amino acid sequence1. This problem is of fundamental importance as the structure of a protein largely determines its function2; however, protein structures can be difficult to determine experimentally. Considerable progress has recently been made by leveraging genetic information. It is possible to infer which amino acid residues are in contact by analysing covariation in homologous sequences, which aids in the prediction of protein structures3. Here we show that we can train a neural network to make accurate predictions of the distances between pairs of residues, which convey more information about the structure than contact predictions. Using this information, we construct a potential of mean force4 that can accurately describe the shape of a protein. We find that the resulting potential can be optimized by a simple gradient descent algorithm to generate structures without complex sampling procedures. The resulting system, named AlphaFold, achieves high accuracy, even for sequences with fewer homologous sequences. In the recent Critical Assessment of Protein Structure Prediction5 (CASP13)—a blind assessment of the state of the field—AlphaFold created high-accuracy structures (with template modelling (TM) scores6 of 0.7 or higher) for 24 out of 43 free modelling domains, whereas the next best method, which used sampling and contact information, achieved such accuracy for only 14 out of 43 domains. AlphaFold represents a considerable advance in protein-structure prediction. We expect this increased accuracy to enable insights into the function and malfunction of proteins, especially in cases for which no structures for homologous proteins have been experimentally determined7.},

Existing centrality algorithms also have a second shortcoming, i.e., the list of the most central nodes are often clustered in a specific region of the network and are not well represented across the network. We address both by proposing Ablatio Triadum (ATria), an iterative centrality algorithm that uses the concept of “payoffs” from economic theory. We compare our algorithm with other known centrality algorithms and demonstrate how ATria overcomes several of their shortcomings. We demonstrate the applicability of our algorithm to synthetic networks as well as biological networks including bacterial co-occurrence networks, sometimes referred to as microbial social networks.

abstract = {The high variability of solar power due to intrinsic diurnal variability, as well as additional stochastic variations due to cloud cover, have made it difficult for solar farms to participate in electricity markets that require pre-committed constant power generation. We study the use of battery storage to 'firm' solar power, that is, to remove variability so that such a pre-commitment can be made. Due to the high cost of storage, it is necessary to size the battery parsimoniously, choosing the minimum size to meet a certain reliability guarantee. Inspired by recent work that identifies an isomorphism between batteries and network buffers, we introduce a new model for solar power generation that models it as a stochastic traffic source. This permits us to use techniques from the stochastic network calculus to both size storage and to maximize the revenue that a solar farm owner can make from the day-ahead power market. Using a 10-year of recorded solar irradiance, we show that our approach attains 93% of the maximum revenue in a summer day that would have been achieved in daily market had the entire solar irradiance trace been known ahead of time.},

abstract = {When monitoring spatial phenomena, which can often be modeled as Gaussian processes (GPs), choosing sensor locations is a fundamental task. There are several common strategies to address this task, for example, geometry or disk models, placing sensors at the points of highest entropy (vari-ance) in the GP model, and A-, D-, or E-optimal design. In this paper, we tackle the combinatorial optimization problem of maximizing the mutual information between the chosen locations and the locations which are not selected. We prove that the problem of finding the configuration that max-imizes mutual information is NP-complete. To address this issue, we describe a polynomial-time approximation that is within (1 − 1/e) of the optimum by exploiting the submodularity of mutual information. We also show how submodularity can be used to obtain online bounds, and design branch and bound search procedures. We then extend our algorithm to exploit lazy evaluations and local structure in the GP, yielding significant speedups. We also extend our approach to find placements which are robust against node failures and uncertainties in the model. These extensions are again associated with rigorous theoretical approximation guarantees, exploiting the submodu-larity of the objective function. We demonstrate the advantages of our approach towards optimizing mutual information in a very extensive empirical study on two real-world data sets.},

abstract = {Background: Transcription factors (TFs) are proteins that can bind to DNA sequences and regulate gene expression. Many TFs are master regulators in cells that contribute to tissue-specific and cell-type-specific gene expression patterns in eukaryotes. Maize has been a model organism for over one hundred years, but little is known about its tissue-specific gene regulation through TFs. In this study, we used a network approach to elucidate gene regulatory networks (GRNs) in four tissues (leaf, root, SAM and seed) in maize. We utilized GENIE3, a machine-learning algorithm combined with large quantity of RNA-Seq expression data to construct four tissue-specific GRNs. Unlike some other techniques, this approach is not limited by high-quality Position Weighed Matrix (PWM), and can therefore predict GRNs for over 2000 TFs in maize. Results: Although many TFs were expressed across multiple tissues, a multi-tiered analysis predicted tissue-specific regulatory functions for many transcription factors. Some well-studied TFs emerged within the four tissue-specific GRNs, and the GRN predictions matched expectations based upon published results for many of these examples. Our GRNs were also validated by ChIP-Seq datasets (KN1, FEA4 and O2). Key TFs were identified for each tissue and matched expectations for key regulators in each tissue, including GO enrichment and identity with known regulatory factors for that tissue. We also found functional modules in each network by clustering analysis with the MCL algorithm. Conclusions: By combining publicly available genome-wide expression data and network analysis, we can uncover GRNs at tissue-level resolution in maize. Since ChIP-Seq and PWMs are still limited in several model organisms, our study provides a uniform platform that can be adapted to any species with genome-wide expression data to construct GRNs. We also present a publicly available database, maize tissue-specific GRN (mGRN, https://www.bio.fsu.edu/mcginnislab/mgrn/ ), for easy querying. All source code and data are available at Github ( https://github.com/timedreamer/maize_tissue-specific_GRN ).},

The data in these tasks are typically represented in the Euclidean space. However, there is an increasing number of applications where data are generated from non-Euclidean domains and are represented as graphs with complex relationships and interdependency between objects. The complexity of graph data has imposed significant challenges on existing machine learning algorithms. Recently, many studies on extending deep learning approaches for graph data have emerged. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of graph neural networks (GNNs) in data mining and machine learning fields. We propose a new taxonomy to divide the state-of-the-art graph neural networks into four categories, namely recurrent graph neural networks, convolutional graph neural networks, graph autoencoders and spatial-temporal graph neural networks. We further discuss the applications of graph neural networks across various domains and summarize the open source codes and benchmarks of the existing algorithms on different learning tasks. Finally, we propose potential research directions in this rapidly growing field.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Social media are dynamic and interactive computer-mediated communication tools that have high penetration rates in the general population in high-income and middle-income countries. However, in medicine and health care, a large number of stakeholders (eg, clinicians, administrators, professional colleges, academic institutions, ministries of health, among others) are unaware of social media's relevance, potential applications in their day-to-day activities, as well as the inherent risks and how these may be attenuated and mitigated. OBJECTIVE: We conducted a narrative review with the aim to present case studies that illustrate how, where, and why social media are being used in the medical and health care sectors. METHODS: Using a critical-interpretivist framework, we used qualitative methods to synthesize the impact and illustrate, explain, and provide contextual knowledge of the applications and potential implementations of social media in medicine and health care. Both traditional (eg, peer-reviewed) and nontraditional (eg, policies, case studies, and social media content) sources were used, in addition to an environmental scan (using Google and Bing Web searches) of resources. RESULTS: We reviewed, evaluated, and synthesized 76 articles, 44 websites, and 11 policies/reports. Results and case studies are presented according to 10 different categories of social media: (1) blogs (eg, WordPress), (2) microblogs (eg, Twitter), (3) social networking sites (eg, Facebook), (4) professional networking sites (eg, LinkedIn, Sermo), (5) thematic networking sites (eg, 23andMe), (6) wikis (eg, Wikipedia), (7) mashups (eg, HealthMap), (8) collaborative filtering sites (eg, Digg), (9) media sharing sites (eg, YouTube, Slideshare), and others (eg, SecondLife). Four recommendations are provided and explained for stakeholders wishing to engage with social media while attenuating risk: (1) maintain professionalism at all times, (2) be authentic, have fun, and do not be afraid, (3) ask for help, and (4) focus, grab attention, and engage. CONCLUSIONS: The role of social media in the medical and health care sectors is far reaching, and many questions in terms of governance, ethics, professionalism, privacy, confidentiality, and information quality remain unanswered. By following the guidelines presented, professionals have a starting point to engage with social media in a safe and ethical manner. Future research will be required to understand the synergies between social media and evidence-based practice, as well as develop institutional policies that benefit patients, clinicians, public health practitioners, and industry alike.},

abstract = {Existing dictionary learning algorithms are based on the assumption that the data are vectors in an Euclidean vector space ℝ (d) , and the dictionary is learned from the training data using the vector space structure of ℝ (d) and its Euclidean L (2)-metric. However, in many applications, features and data often originated from a Riemannian manifold that does not support a global linear (vector space) structure. Furthermore, the extrinsic viewpoint of existing dictionary learning algorithms becomes inappropriate for modeling and incorporating the intrinsic geometry of the manifold that is potentially important and critical to the application. This paper proposes a novel framework for sparse coding and dictionary learning for data on a Riemannian manifold, and it shows that the existing sparse coding and dictionary learning methods can be considered as special (Euclidean) cases of the more general framework proposed here. We show that both the dictionary and sparse coding can be effectively computed for several important classes of Riemannian manifolds, and we validate the proposed method using two well-known classification problems in computer vision and medical imaging analysis.},

Among possible research areas, video summarization is an important topic that potentially enables faster browsing of large video collections and also more efficient content indexing and access. Essentially, this research area consists of automatically generating a short summary of a video, which can either be a static summary or a dynamic summary. In this paper, we present VSUMM, a methodology for the production of static video summaries. The method is based on color feature extraction from video frames and k-means clustering algorithm. As an additional contribution, we also develop a novel approach for the evaluation of video static summaries. In this evaluation methodology, video summaries are manually created by users. Then, several user-created summaries are compared both to our approach and also to a number of different techniques in the literature. Experimental results show - with a confidence level of 98% - that the proposed solution provided static video summaries with superior quality relative to the approaches to which it was compared. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Identifying influential nodes in very large-scale directed networks is a big challenge relevant to disparate applications, such as accelerating information propagation, controlling rumors and diseases, designing search engines, and understanding hierarchical organization of social and biological networks. Known methods range from node centralities, such as degree, closeness and betweenness, to diffusion-based processes, like PageRank and LeaderRank. Some of these methods already take into account the influences of a node's neighbors but do not directly make use of the interactions among it's neighbors. Local clustering is known to have negative impacts on the information spreading. We further show empirically that it also plays a negative role in generating local connections. Inspired by these facts, we propose a local ranking algorithm named ClusterRank, which takes into account not only the number of neighbors and the neighbors' influences, but also the clustering coefficient. Subject to the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) spreading model with constant infectivity, experimental results on two directed networks, a social network extracted from delicious.com and a large-scale short-message communication network, demonstrate that the ClusterRank outperforms some benchmark algorithms such as PageRank and LeaderRank. Furthermore, ClusterRank can also be applied to undirected networks where the superiority of ClusterRank is significant compared with degree centrality and k-core decomposition. In addition, ClusterRank, only making use of local information, is much more efficient than global methods: It takes only 191 seconds for a network with about [Formula: see text] nodes, more than 15 times faster than PageRank.},

The problem can be approximated up to a factor 1 − 1 / e in polynomial time. In the streaming-set model, the sets and their elements are revealed online. The main goal of our work is to design algorithms, with approximation guarantees as close as possible to 1 − 1 / e, that use sublinear space o(mn). Our main results are: Two (1 − 1 / e− ?) approximation algorithms: One uses O(?− 1) passes and {\~{O}}(?− 2k) space whereas the other uses only a single pass but {\~{O}}(?− 2m) space. {\~{O}}(⋅) suppresses polylog factors.We show that any approximation factor better than (1 − (1 − 1 / k) k) ≈ 1 − 1 / e in constant passes requires $\Omega$ (m) space for constant k even if the algorithm is allowed unbounded processing time. We also demonstrate a single-pass, (1 − ?) approximation algorithm using {\~{O}}(?− 2m⋅ min (k, ?− 1)) space. We also study the maximum k-vertex coverage problem in the dynamic graph stream model. In this model, the stream consists of edge insertions and deletions of a graph on N vertices. The goal is to find k vertices that cover the most number of distinct edges. We show that any constant approximation in constant passes requires $\Omega$ (N) space for constant k whereas {\~{O}}(?− 2N) space is sufficient for a (1 − ?) approximation and arbitrary k in a single pass.For regular graphs, we show that {\~{O}}(?− 3k) space is sufficient for a (1 − ?) approximation in a single pass. We generalize this to a ($\kappa$− ?) approximation when the ratio between the minimum and maximum degree is bounded below by $\kappa$.},

abstract = {Some epidemic spreading models are usually applied to analyze the propagation of opinions or news. However, the dynamics of epidemic spreading and information or behavior spreading are essentially different in many aspects. Centola's experiments [Science 329, 1194 (2010)] on behavior spreading in online social networks showed that the spreading is faster and broader in regular networks than in random networks. This result contradicts with the former understanding that random networks are preferable for spreading than regular networks. To describe the spreading in online social networks, a unknown-known-approved-exhausted four-status model was proposed, which emphasizes the effect of social reinforcement and assumes that the redundant signals can improve the probability of approval (i.e., the spreading rate). Performing the model on regular and random networks, it is found that our model can well explain the results of Centola's experiments on behavior spreading and some former studies on information spreading in different parameter space. The effects of average degree and network size on behavior spreading process are further analyzed. The results again show the importance of social reinforcement and are accordant with Centola's anticipation that increasing the network size or decreasing the average degree will enlarge the difference of the density of final approved nodes between regular and random networks. Our work complements the former studies on spreading dynamics, especially the spreading in online social networks where the information usually requires individuals' confirmations before being transmitted to others.},

abstract = {A longstanding goal in deep learning research has been to precisely characterize training and generalization. However, the often complex loss landscapes of neural networks have made a theory of learning dynamics elusive. In this work, we show that for wide neural networks the learning dynamics simplify considerably and that, in the infinite width limit, they are governed by a linear model obtained from the first-order Taylor expansion of the network around its initial parameters. Furthermore, mirroring the correspondence between wide Bayesian neural networks and Gaussian processes, gradient-based training of wide neural networks with a squared loss produces test set predictions drawn from a Gaussian process with a particular compositional kernel. While these theoretical results are only exact in the infinite width limit, we nevertheless find excellent empirical agreement between the predictions of the original network and those of the linearized version even for finite practically-sized networks. This agreement is robust across different architectures, optimization methods, and loss functions.},

Closeness centrality is usually interpreted either as a measure of access efficiency or of independence from potential control by intermediaries. Betweenness and closeness are commonly assumed to be related for two reasons: first, because of their conceptual duality with respect to dependency, and second, because both are defined in terms of shortest paths. We show that the first of these ideas - the duality - is not only true in a general conceptual sense but also in precise mathematical terms. This becomes apparent when the two indices are expressed in terms of a shared dyadic dependency relation. We also show that the second idea - the shortest paths - is false because it is not preserved when the indices are generalized using the standard definition of shortest paths in valued graphs. This unveils that closeness-as-independence is in fact different from closeness-as-efficiency, and we propose a variant notion of distance that maintains the duality of closeness-as-independence with betweenness also on valued relations.},

Real-world data often exhibit significantly skewed class distributions, where samples from one class dominate over the other. While active learning has been extensively studied, there have been limited research efforts to develop active learning algorithms specifically for class imbalance applications. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to address this research challenge. We pose the active sample selection as a constrained optimization problem and derive a linear programming relaxation to select a batch of samples. Contrary to existing algorithms, our framework is generic and is applicable to both binary and multi-class problems, where the imbalance may exist across multiple classes. Our extensive empirical studies on four vision datasets spanning three different application domains (face, facial expression and handwritten digits recognition) with varied degrees of class imbalance demonstrate the promise and potential of the method for real-world imbalanced data applications.},

Concretely, for a monotone and continuous DR-submodular function, SCG++ achieves a tight [(1 − 1/e)OPT − ] solution while using O(1// 2) stochastic gradients and O(1//) calls to the linear optimization oracle. The best previously known algorithms either achieve a suboptimal [(1/2)OPT − ] solution with O(1// 2) stochastic gradients or the tight [(1 − 1/e)OPT − ] solution with suboptimal O(1// 3) stochastic gradients. We further provide an information-theoretic lower bound to showcase the necessity of O(1// 2) stochastic oracle queries in order to achieve [(1 − 1/e)OPT − ] for monotone and DR-submodular functions. This result shows that our proposed SCG++ enjoys optimality in terms of both approximation guarantee, i.e., (1−1/e) approximation factor, and stochastic gradient evaluations, i.e., O(1// 2) calls to the stochastic oracle. By using stochastic continuous optimization as an interface, we also show that it is possible to obtain the [(1 − 1/e)OPT − ] tight approximation guarantee for maximizing a monotone but stochastic submodular set function subject to a general matroid constraint after at most O(n 2 // 2) calls to the stochastic function value, where n is the number of elements in the ground set.},

The first variant assumes that there is uncertainty regarding whether a selected set can cover an item, and the objective is to determine a minimum-cost combination of sets so that each item is covered with a prespecified probability. The second variant seeks to maximize the minimum probability that a selected set can cover all items. To date, literature on this problem has focused on the special case in which uncertainties are independent. In this paper, we formulate deterministic mixed-integer programming models for distributionally robust PSC problems with correlated uncertainties. By exploiting the supermodularity of certain substructures and analyzing their polyhedral properties, we develop strong valid inequalities to strengthen the formulations. Computational results illustrate that our modeling approach can outperform formulations in which correlations are ignored and that our algorithms can significantly reduce overall computation time.

Betweenness is, in some sense, a measure of the influence a node has over the spread of information through the network. By counting only shortest paths, however, the conventional definition implicitly assumes that information spreads only along those shortest paths. Here, we propose a betweenness measure that relaxes this assumption, including contributions from essentially all paths between nodes, not just the shortest, although it still gives more weight to short paths. The measure is based on random walks, counting how often a node is traversed by a random walk between two other nodes. We show how our measure can be calculated using matrix methods, and give some examples of its application to particular networks.},

Graph theoretic, simulation, and optimization-based techniques have played a significant role in examining potential network vulnerabilities given the insights they can provide for mitigating facility loss and prioritizing fortification efforts. Central to these approaches is the concept of facility (arc—node) importance or criticality to system survivability. Assessments of network vulnerability can dramatically differ based on how facility importance is characterized. In this review, various approaches for assessing facility importance and network vulnerability are examined. The key differences in these approaches are the ways in which a facility's role in maintaining network operability is evaluated given arc—node disruption. Comparative results suggest significant differences exist among measures of facility importance and network performance. Furthermore, the subsequent incongruities in these measures and their implications need to be clearly understood to support interdiction risk and vulnerability assessment for critical infrastructures.},

In addition, we provide a unique longitudinal perspective on the size of Google and Bing's indices over a nine-year period, from March 2006 until January 2015. We find that index size estimates of these two search engines tend to vary dramatically over time, with Google generally possessing a larger index than Bing. This result raises doubts about the reliability of previous one-off estimates of the size of the indexed Web. We find that much, if not all of this variability can be explained by changes in the indexing and ranking infrastructure of Google and Bing.

abstract = {It is becoming increasingly important to understand the vulnerability of machine learning models to adversarial attacks. In this paper we study the feasibility of robust learning from the perspective of computational learning theory, considering both sample and computational complexity. In particular, our definition of robust learnability requires polynomial sample complexity. We start with two negative results. We show that no non-trivial concept class can be robustly learned in the distribution-free setting against an adversary who can perturb just a single input bit. We show moreover that the class of monotone conjunctions cannot be robustly learned under the uniform distribution against an adversary who can perturb $\omega(\log n)$ input bits. However if the adversary is restricted to perturbing $O(\log n)$ bits, then the class of monotone conjunctions can be robustly learned with respect to a general class of distributions (that includes the uniform distribution). Finally, we provide a simple proof of the computational hardness of robust learning on the boolean hypercube. Unlike previous results of this nature, our result does not rely on another computational model (e.g. the statistical query model) nor on any hardness assumption other than the existence of a hard learning problem in the PAC framework.},

Recent large-scale power outages demonstrated the limitations of percolation- and epidemic-based tools in modeling failures and cascades in power grids. Hence, we study failures and cascades by using computational tools and a linearized power flow model. We first obtain results regarding the Moore-Penrose pseudo-inverse of the power grid admittance matrix. Based on these results, we analytically study the impact of a single line failure on the flows on other lines and introduce metrics to evaluate the robustness of grids to failures. We also illustrate via simulation the impact of the distance and resistance distance on the flow increase following a failure, and discuss the difference from the epidemic models. We use the pseudoinverse of admittance matrix to develop an efficient algorithm to identify the cascading failure evolution, which can be a building block for cascade mitigation. Finally, we show that finding the lines whose removal results in the minimum yield (the fraction of demand satisfied after the cascade) is NP-Hard and present a simple heuristic for finding such a set . Overall, the results demonstrate that using the resistance distance and the pseudoinverse of admittance matrix provides important insights and can support the development of algorithms for designing robust power grids and controlling the evolution of a cascade upon failures.},

abstract = {In distributed learning, the goal is to perform a learning task over data distributed across multiple nodes with minimal (expensive) communication. Prior work (Daume III et al., 2012) proposes a general model that bounds the communication required for learning classifiers while allowing for $\eps$ training error on linearly separable data adversarially distributed across nodes. In this work, we develop key improvements and extensions to this basic model. Our first result is a two-party multiplicative-weight-update based protocol that uses $O(d^2 \log{1/\eps})$ words of communication to classify distributed data in arbitrary dimension $d$, $\eps$-optimally. This readily extends to classification over $k$ nodes with $O(kd^2 \log{1/\eps})$ words of communication. Our proposed protocol is simple to implement and is considerably more efficient than baselines compared, as demonstrated by our empirical results. In addition, we illustrate general algorithm design paradigms for doing efficient learning over distributed data. We show how to solve fixed-dimensional and high dimensional linear programming efficiently in a distributed setting where constraints may be distributed across nodes. Since many learning problems can be viewed as convex optimization problems where constraints are generated by individual points, this models many typical distributed learning scenarios. Our techniques make use of a novel connection from multipass streaming, as well as adapting the multiplicative-weight-update framework more generally to a distributed setting. As a consequence, our methods extend to the wide range of problems solvable using these techniques.},

Finding CS is one of fundamental yet challenging topics in network science. One of the most popular classes of methods for this problem is to maximize Newman's modularity. However, there is a little understood on how well we can approximate the maximum modularity as well as the implications of finding community structure with provable guarantees. In this paper, we settle definitely the approximability of modularity clustering, proving that approximating the problem within any (multiplicative) positive factor is intractable, unless P = NP. Yet we propose the first additive approximation algorithm for modularity clustering with a constant factor. Moreover, we provide a rigorous proof that a CS with modularity arbitrary close to maximum modularity QOPT might bear no similarity to the optimal CS of maximum modularity. Thus even when CS with near-optimal modularity are found, other verification methods are needed to confirm the significance of the structure.},

abstract = {Information flow in social network is assumed to be transmitted from node to node through the edges of network. In real world, however, people are influenced not only by local social neighbors but also by out-of-network services and sources, such as mass media and external websites. As a consequence, in addition to spreading by social edges, information can also reach a long-distance node by "jumping" cross the network. Then one of important issues coming out of the phenomenon is: how do these external services affect the diffusion process in social network? In this paper we develop an algorithm which allows us to distinguish the effects of external influence in diffusion process. By applying the algorithm to millions of diffusion cascades, we find that, although only a small portion of reshare activities arise from external influence directly, external influence plays a significant role in information diffusion. In particular, external influence affects nearly 50% to 70% of cascade node in average, and the effects become stronger as the cascade becomes larger. In addition, we characterize external influence as two categories, and show that one category mainly affects the size of diffusion tree and the other focuses on affecting the depth. Finally, we find that, due to the external services, the influentials become less important and more large cascades can be triggered by ordinary people. Together, these observations suggest new directions for modeling diffusion process and constructing more useful viral marketing strategy.},

In particular, we obtain an alternative proof of a generalization bound for Gaussian kernel ridge regression via a DRO lense. The proof also suggests a new regularizer.

Several of these techniques use probability distributions to represent the "objects" they intend to retrieve. We present a novel approach to search such collections of distributions efficiently. Like many standard data structures, our method uses an "average" to represent a large set (Le., cluster) of objects, thus allowing the search to disregard an unpromising subset with only one comparison to its average. Our contribution lies in choosing the average: Inspired by information theory, we choose a representative that is optimally "close" in a minimax sense to all members of its set when measured using the Kullback-Liebler (KL) divergence. We present a texture retrieval system and test it on the CUReT database, measuring accuracy and efficiency. We find that using the KL-center yields speed ups of more than a factor of three over an exhaustive search while guaranteeing identical accuracy. The KL-center also out-performs other commonly used representatives such as the arithmetic mean. Although we present results only in texture retrieval, our approach will likely aid image and shape retrieval as well.},

It is a key component of many efforts to transform care and achieve better population health. Expansion of health information technology and consumer e-health tools--electronic tools and services such as secure e-mail messaging between patients and providers, or mobile health apps--have created new opportunities for individuals to participate actively in monitoring and directing their health and health care. The Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology in the Department of Health and Human Services leads the strategy to increase electronic access to health information, support the development of tools that enable people to take action with that information, and shift attitudes related to the traditional roles of patients and providers. In this article we review recent evidence in support of consumer e-health and present the federal strategy to promote advances in consumer e-health to increase patient engagement, improve individual health, and achieve broader health care system improvements.},

abstract = {Society relies heavily on its networked physical infrastructure and information systems. Accurately assessing the vulnerability of these systems against disruptive events is vital for planning and risk management. Existing approaches to vulnerability assessments of large-scale systems mainly focus on investigating inhomogeneous properties of the underlying graph elements. These measures and the associated heuristic solutions are limited in evaluating the vulnerability of large-scale network topologies. Furthermore, these approaches often fail to provide performance guarantees of the proposed solutions. In this paper, we propose a vulnerability measure, pairwise connectivity, and use it to formulate network vulnerability assessment as a graph-theoretical optimization problem, referred to as -disruptor. The objective is to identify the minimum set of critical network elements, namely nodes and edges, whose removal results in a specific degradation of the network global pairwise connectivity. We prove the NP-completeness and inapproximability of this problem and propose an pseudo-approximation algorithm to computing the set of critical nodes and an pseudo-approximation algorithm for computing the set of critical edges. The results of an extensive simulation-based experiment show the feasibility of our proposed vulnerability assessment framework and the efficiency of the proposed approximation algorithms in comparison to other approaches.},

abstract = {We address the problem of image collection summarization by learning mixtures of submodular functions. Submodularity is useful for this problem since it naturally represents characteristics such as fidelity and diversity, desirable for any summary. Several previously proposed image summarization scoring methodologies, in fact, instinctively arrived at submodularity. We provide classes of submodular component functions (including some which are instantiated via a deep neural network) over which mixtures may be learnt. We formulate the learning of such mixtures as a supervised problem via large-margin structured prediction. As a loss function, and for automatic summary scoring, we introduce a novel summary evaluation method called V-ROUGE, and test both submodular and non-submodular optimization (using the submodular-supermodular procedure) to learn a mixture of submodular functions. Interestingly, using non-submodular optimization to learn submodular functions provides the best results. We also provide a new data set consisting of 14 real-world image collections along with many human-generated ground truth summaries collected using Amazon Mechanical Turk. We compare our method with previous work on this problem and show that our learning approach outperforms all competitors on this new data set. This paper provides, to our knowledge, the first systematic approach for quantifying the problem of image collection summarization, along with a new data set of image collections and human summaries.},

Khalil et al. proposed an end-to-end reinforcement learning framework, S2V-DQN, which automatically learns graph embeddings to construct solutions to a wide range of problems. To improve the generalization ability of their Q-learning method, we propose a novel learning strategy based on AlphaGo Zero which is a Go engine that achieved a superhuman level without the domain knowledge of the game. Our framework is redesigned for combinatorial problems, where the final reward might take any real number instead of a binary response, win/lose. In experiments conducted for five kinds of NP-hard problems including {\sc MinimumVertexCover} and {\sc MaxCut}, our method is shown to generalize better to various graphs than S2V-DQN. Furthermore, our method can be combined with recently-developed graph neural network (GNN) models such as the \emph{Graph Isomorphism Network}, resulting in even better performance. This experiment also gives an interesting insight into a suitable choice of GNN models for each task.},

abstract = {Given a social network G and a constant k, the influence maximization problem asks for k nodes in G that (directly and indirectly) influence the largest number of nodes under a pre-defined diffusion model. This problem finds important applications in viral marketing, and has been extensively studied in the literature. Existing algorithms for influence maximization, however, either trade approximation guarantees for practical efficiency, or vice versa. In particular, among the algorithms that achieve constant factor approximations under the prominent independent cascade (IC) model or linear threshold (LT) model, none can handle a million-node graph without incurring prohibitive overheads. This paper presents TIM, an algorithm that aims to bridge the theory and practice in influence maximization. On the theory side, we show that TIM runs in O((k+\ell) (n+m) \log n / \epsilon^2) expected time and returns a (1-1/e-\epsilon)-approximate solution with at least 1 - n^{-\ell} probability. The time complexity of TIM is near-optimal under the IC model, as it is only a \log n factor larger than the \Omega(m + n) lower-bound established in previous work (for fixed k, \ell, and \epsilon). Moreover, TIM supports the triggering model, which is a general diffusion model that includes both IC and LT as special cases. On the practice side, TIM incorporates novel heuristics that significantly improve its empirical efficiency without compromising its asymptotic performance. We experimentally evaluate TIM with the largest datasets ever tested in the literature, and show that it outperforms the state-of-the-art solutions (with approximation guarantees) by up to four orders of magnitude in terms of running time. In particular, when k = 50, \epsilon = 0.2, and \ell = 1, TIM requires less than one hour on a commodity machine to process a network with 41.6 million nodes and 1.4 billion edges.},

@inproceedings{Goyal2013,
abstract = {In recent years, study of influence propagation in social networks has gained tremendous attention. In this context, we can identify three orthogonal dimensions—the number of seed nodes activated at the beginning (known as budget ), the expected number of activated nodes at the end of the propagation (known as expected spread or coverage ), and the time taken for the propagation. We can constrain one or two of these and try to optimize the third. In their seminal paper, Kempe et al. constrained the budget, left time unconstrained, and maximized the coverage: this problem is known as Influence Maximization (or MAXINF for short). In this paper, we study alternative optimization problems which are naturally motivated by resource and time constraints on viral marketing campaigns. In the first problem, termed minimum target set selection (or MINTSS for short), a coverage threshold $\eta$ is given and the task is to find the minimum size seed set such that by activating it, at least $\eta$ nodes are eventually activated in the expected sense. This naturally captures the problem of deploying a viral campaign on a budget. In the second problem, termed MINTIME, the goal is to minimize the time in which a predefined coverage is achieved. More precisely, in MINTIME, a coverage threshold $\eta$ and a budget threshold k are given, and the task is to find a seed set of size at most k such that by activating it, at least $\eta$ nodes are activated in the expected sense, in the minimum possible time . This problem addresses the issue of timing when deploying viral campaigns. Both these problems are NP -hard, which motivates our interest in their approximation. For MINTSS, we develop a simple greedy algorithm and show that it provides a bicriteria approximation. We also establish a generic hardness result suggesting that improving this bicriteria approximation is likely to be hard. For MINTIME, we show that even bicriteria and tricriteria approximations are hard under several conditions. We show, however, that if we allow the budget for number of seeds k to be boosted by a logarithmic factor and allow the coverage to fall short, then the problem can be solved exactly in PTIME, i.e., we can achieve the required coverage within the time achieved by the optimal solution to MINTIME with budget k and coverage threshold $\eta$. Finally, we establish the value of the approximation algorithms, by conducting an experimental evaluation, comparing their quality against that achieved by various heuristics.},

We next introduce a powerful coupling scheme which reduces the multiple networks into a single network without changing influencing properties, thereby allowing us to solve the problem in the reduced network. Moreover, the coupling scheme is also an efficient tool to investigate various aspects of the influence propagation on multiple OSNs.

Observational data suggest that a wide variety of behaviors may spread in human social networks, but subjects in such studies can choose to befriend people with similar behaviors, posing difficulty for causal inference. Here, we exploit a seminal set of laboratory experiments that originally showed that voluntary costly punishment can help sustain cooperation. In these experiments, subjects were randomly assigned to a sequence of different groups to play a series of single-shot public goods games with strangers; this feature allowed us to draw networks of interactions to explore how cooperative and uncooperative behaviors spread from person to person to person. We show that, in both an ordinary public goods game and in a public goods game with punishment focal individuals are influenced by fellow group members' contribution behavior in future interactions with other individuals who were not a party to the initial interaction. Furthermore, this influence persists for multiple periods and spreads up to three degrees of separation (f rpm person to person to person to person). The results suggest that each additional contribution a subject makes to the public good in the first period is tripled over the course of the experiment by other subjects who are directly or indirectly influenced to contribute more as a consequence. These results show experimentally that cooperative behavior cascades in human social netowrks.},

Although many researches have been done, the evolving feature of information diffusion hasn't been well treated, including the promising direction of group-level popularity prediction. To this end, we identify the Incremental Group-level Popularity Prediction (IGPP) problem, and propose a novel model IGP-P to address it. We first conduct preprocess on the target topic being predicted, so as to build the initial group-level popularity tensor. Then, we predict the group-level popularity incrementally by exploiting the incremental CP decomposition algorithm. To reduce the cumulative error by incremental prediction, we propose two strategies to restart the CP decomposition. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments in two real datasets. The results show significant improvements of the IGPP method over other works both in the prediction accuracy and the efficiency.

DR-submodularity captures a subclass of non-convex functions that enables both exact minimization and approximate maximization in polynomial time. In this work we study the problem of maximizing non-monotone DR-submodular continuous functions under general down-closed convex constraints. We start by investigating geometric properties that underlie such objectives, e.g., a strong relation between (approximately) stationary points and global optimum is proved. These properties are then used to devise two optimization algorithms with provable guarantees. Concretely, we first devise a "two-phase" algorithm with $1/4$ approximation guarantee. This algorithm allows the use of existing methods for finding (approximately) stationary points as a subroutine, thus, harnessing recent progress in non-convex optimization. Then we present a non-monotone Frank-Wolfe variant with $1/e$ approximation guarantee and sublinear convergence rate. Finally, we extend our approach to a broader class of generalized DR-submodular continuous functions, which captures a wider spectrum of applications.

abstract = {Long-Term Evolution (LTE) allows operators to use new and wider spectrum and complements 3G networks with higher data rates, lower latency and a flat IP-based architecture. To further improve broadband user experience in a ubiquitous and cost effective manner, 3GPP has been working on various aspects in the framework of LTE Advanced. Since radio link performance is approaching theoretical limits with 3G enhancements and LTE, the next performance leap in wireless networks will come from the network topology. LTE Advanced is about improving spectral efficiency per unit area. Using a mix of macro, pico, femto and relay base-stations, heterogeneous networks enable flexible and low-cost deployments and provide a uniform broadband experience to users anywhere in the network. This paper discusses the need for an alternative deployment model or topology using heterogeneous networks. To enhance the performance of these networks, advanced techniques are described which are needed to manage and control interference and deliver the full benefits of such networks. Range extension allows more user terminals to benefit directly from low-power base-stations such as picos, femtos, and relays. Adaptive inter-cell interference coordination provides smart resource allocation amongst interfering cells and improves inter-cell fairness in a heterogeneous network. In addition, the performance gains with heterogeneous networks using an example macro/pico network are shown.},

abstract = {We consider a problem of considerable practical interest: the recovery of a data matrix from a sampling of its entries. Suppose that we observe m entries selected uniformly at random from a matrix M. Can we complete the matrix and recover the entries that we have not seen? We show that one can perfectly recover most low-rank matrices from what appears to be an incomplete set of entries. We prove that if the number m of sampled entries obeys m >= C n^{1.2} r log n for some positive numerical constant C, then with very high probability, most n by n matrices of rank r can be perfectly recovered by solving a simple convex optimization program. This program finds the matrix with minimum nuclear norm that fits the data. The condition above assumes that the rank is not too large. However, if one replaces the 1.2 exponent with 1.25, then the result holds for all values of the rank. Similar results hold for arbitrary rectangular matrices as well. Our results are connected with the recent literature on compressed sensing, and show that objects other than signals and images can be perfectly reconstructed from very limited information.},

By assuming the underlying matrix has a low rank, our formulation is able to handle three problems simultaneously: i) multi-label learning, where each item has more than one label, ii) transduction, where most of these labels are unspecified, and iii) missing data, where a large number of features are missing. We obtained satisfactory results on several real-world tasks, suggesting that the low rank assumption may not be as restrictive as it seems. Our method allows for different loss functions to apply on the feature and label entries of the matrix.

abstract = {Recent advances in the study of networked systems have highlighted that our interconnected world is composed of networks that are coupled to each other through different "layers" that each represent one of many possible subsystems or types of interactions. Nevertheless, it is traditional to aggregate multilayer networks into a single weighted network in order to take advantage of existing tools. This is admittedly convenient, but it is also extremely problematic, as important information can be lost as a result. It is therefore important to develop multilayer generalizations of network concepts. In this paper, we analyze triadic relations and generalize the idea of transitivity to multiplex networks. By focusing on triadic relations, which yield the simplest type of transitivity, we generalize the concept and computation of clustering coefficients to multiplex networks. We show how the layered structure of such networks introduces a new degree of freedom that has a fundamental effect on transitivity. We compute multiplex clustering coefficients for several real multiplex networks and illustrate why one must take great care when generalizing standard network concepts to multiplex networks. We also derive analytical expressions for our clustering coefficients for ensemble averages of networks in a family of random multiplex networks. Our analysis illustrates that social networks have a strong tendency to promote redundancy by closing triads at every layer and that they thereby have a different type of multiplex transitivity from transportation networks, which do not exhibit such a tendency. These insights are invisible if one only studies aggregated networks.},

We show that the Lempel-Ziv parsing of a string of length $n$ on an alphabet of size $\sigma$ can be computed in $O(n\log\log\sigma)$ time ($O(n)$ time if we allow randomization) using $O(n\log\sigma)$ bits of working space; that is, using space proportional to that of the input string in bits. The previous fastest algorithm using $O(n\log\sigma)$ space takes $O(n(\log\sigma+\log\log n))$ time. We also consider the important rightmost variant of the problem, where the goal is to associate with each phrase of the parsing its most recent occurrence in the input string. We solve this problem in $O(n(1 + (\log\sigma/\sqrt{\log n}))$ time, using the same working space as above. The previous best solution for rightmost parsing uses $O(n(1+\log\sigma/\log\log n))$ time and $O(n\log n)$ space. As a bonus, in our solution for rightmost parsing we provide a faster construction method for efficient 2D orthogonal range reporting, which is of independent interest.},

abstract = {Whilst the future for social media in chronic disease management appears to be optimistic, there is limited concrete evidence indicating whether and how social media use significantly improves patient outcomes. This review examines the health outcomes and related effects of using social media, while also exploring the unique affordances underpinning these effects. Few studies have investigated social media's potential in chronic disease, but those we found indicate impact on health status and other effects are positive, with none indicating adverse events. Benefits have been reported for psychosocial management via the ability to foster support and share information; however, there is less evidence of benefits for physical condition management. We found that studies covered a very limited range of social media platforms and that there is an ongoing propensity towards reporting investigations of earlier social platforms, such as online support groups (OSG), discussion forums and message boards. Finally, it is hypothesized that for social media to form a more meaningful part of effective chronic disease management, interventions need to be tailored to the individualized needs of sufferers. The particular affordances of social media that appear salient in this regard from analysis of the literature include: identity, flexibility, structure, narration and adaptation. This review suggests further research of high methodological quality is required to investigate the affordances of social media and how these can best serve chronic disease sufferers. Evidence-based practice (EBP) using social media may then be considered. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To foster informed decision-making about health social networking (SN) by patients and clinicians, the authors evaluated the quality/safety of SN sites' policies and practices.\n\nDESIGN: Multisite structured observation of diabetes-focused SN sites. Measurements 28 indicators of quality and safety covering: (1) alignment of content with diabetes science and clinical practice recommendations; (2) safety practices for auditing content, supporting transparency and moderation; (3) accessibility of privacy policies and the communication and control of privacy risks; and (4) centralized sharing of member data and member control over sharing.\n\nRESULTS: Quality was variable across n=10 sites: 50% were aligned with diabetes science/clinical practice recommendations with gaps in medical disclaimer use (30% have) and specification of relevant glycosylated hemoglobin levels (0% have). Safety was mixed with gaps in external review approaches (20% used audits and association links) and internal review approaches (70% use moderation). Internal safety review offers limited protection: misinformation about a diabetes 'cure' was found on four moderated sites. Of nine sites with advertising, transparency was missing on five; ads for unfounded 'cures' were present on three. Technological safety was poor with almost no use of procedures for secure data storage and transmission; only three sites support member controls over personal information. Privacy policies' poor readability impedes risk communication. Only three sites (30%) demonstrated better practice. Limitations English-language diabetes sites only.\n\nCONCLUSION: The quality/safety of diabetes SN is variable. Observed better practice suggests improvement is feasible. Mechanisms for improvement are recommended that engage key stakeholders to balance autonomy, community ownership, conditions for innovation, and consumer protection.},

We conducted this study to evaluate the effectiveness of sclerotherapy using OK-432 in treatment of BCC.\n\nSTUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Case series with planned data collection.\n\nSUBJECTS AND METHODS: From 2004 to 2007, we treated 23 patients with BCC using OK-432 sclerotherapy. Of these 23 patients, 18 had unilocular cysts and five had multilocular cysts. The sizes of the BCCs were measured and compared before and after treatment.\n\nRESULTS: Of the 23 cases, 14 (60.8%) showed complete regression; all of these were unilocular cysts. Of the remaining individuals with unilocular cysts, only one patient failed to show any response. This individual subsequently underwent surgical excision. A total of five patients with multilocular cysts showed no or partial response and subsequently underwent surgical excision. Minor adverse effects including fever and local pain were reported by 13 (56.5%) patients.\n\nCONCLUSION: These results suggest that sclerotherapy using OK-432 is an effective and safe treatment modality for BCC, especially for unilocular cysts. Sclerosing of unilocular BCC with OK-432 should therefore be considered before surgical excision.},

abstract = {It has recently been found that some RNA functions are determined by the actual folding kinetics and not just the RNA's nucleotide sequence or its native structure. We present new computational tools for simulating and analyzing RNA folding kinetic metrics such as population kinetics, folding rates, and the folding of particular subsequences. Our method first builds an approximate representation (called a map) of the RNA's folding energy landscape, and then uses specialized analysis techniques to extract folding kinetics from the map. We provide a new sampling strategy called Probabilistic Boltzmann Sampling (PBS) that enables us to approximate the folding landscape with much smaller maps, typically by several orders of magnitude. We also describe a new analysis technique, Map-based Monte Carlo (MMC) simulation, to stochastically extract folding pathways from the map. We demonstrate that our technique can be applied to large RNA (e.g., 200+ nucleotides), where representing the full landscape is infeasible, and that our tools provide results comparable to other simulation methods that work on complete energy landscapes. We present results showing that our approach computes the same relative functional rates as seen in experiments for the relative plasmid replication rates of ColE1 RNAII and its mutants, and for the relative gene expression rates of MS2 phage RNA and its mutants.},

An important open problem is the classical setting of matroid constraint, which has been instrumental for developments in submodular function maximization. In this paper we develop a general strategy to parallelize the well-studied greedy algorithm and use it to obtain a randomized (1/2 − ϵ)-approximation in O log2(n)/ϵ2 rounds of adaptivity. We rely on this algorithm, and an elegant amplification approach due to Badanidiyuru and Vondr{\'{a}}k to obtain a fractional solution that yields a near-optimal randomized (1 − 1/e − ϵ)-approximation in O log2(n)/ϵ3 rounds of adaptivity. For non-negative functions we obtain a 3 − 22 − ϵ - approximation and a fractional solution that yields a (1/e − ϵ)-approximation. Our approach for parallelizing greedy yields approximations for intersections of matroids and matchoids, and the approximation ratios are comparable to those known for sequential greedy.},

abstract = {How well does a classic deep net architecture like AlexNet or VGG19 classify on a standard dataset such as CIFAR-10 when its "width" --- namely, number of channels in convolutional layers, and number of nodes in fully-connected internal layers --- is allowed to increase to infinity? Such questions have come to the forefront in the quest to theoretically understand deep learning and its mysteries about optimization and generalization. They also connect deep learning to notions such as Gaussian processes and kernels. A recent paper [Jacot et al., 2018] introduced the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) which captures the behavior of fully-connected deep nets in the infinite width limit trained by gradient descent; this object was implicit in some other recent papers. A subsequent paper [Lee et al., 2019] gave heuristic Monte Carlo methods to estimate the NTK and its extension, Convolutional Neural Tangent Kernel (CNTK) and used this to try to understand the limiting behavior on datasets like CIFAR-10. The current paper gives the first efficient exact algorithm (based upon dynamic programming) for computing CNTK as well as an efficient GPU implementation of this algorithm. This results in a significant new benchmark for performance of a pure kernel-based method on CIFAR-10, being 10% higher than the methods reported in [Novak et al., 2019], and only 5% lower than the performance of the corresponding finite deep net architecture (once batch normalization etc. are turned off). We give the first non-asymptotic proof showing that a fully-trained sufficiently wide net is indeed equivalent to the kernel regression predictor using NTK. Our experiments also demonstrate that earlier Monte Carlo approximation can degrade the performance significantly, thus highlighting the power of our exact kernel computation, which we have applied even to the full CIFAR-10 dataset and 20-layer nets.},

Our methods allow a direct control over the number of obtained features as opposed to regularization parameters that only implicitly control sparsity.

abstract = {Recovering a large matrix from a small subset of its entries is a challenging problem arising in many real applications, such as image inpainting and recommender systems. Many existing approaches formulate this problem as a general low-rank matrix approximation problem. Since the rank operator is nonconvex and discontinuous, most of the recent theoretical studies use the nuclear norm as a convex relaxation. One major limitation of the existing approaches based on nuclear norm minimization is that all the singular values are simultaneously minimized, and thus the rank may not be well approximated in practice. In this paper, we propose to achieve a better approximation to the rank of matrix by truncated nuclear norm, which is given by the nuclear norm subtracted by the sum of the largest few singular values. In addition, we develop a novel matrix completion algorithm by minimizing the Truncated Nuclear Norm. We further develop three efficient iterative procedures, TNNR-ADMM, TNNR-APGL, and TNNR-ADMMAP, to solve the optimization problem. TNNR-ADMM utilizes the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), while TNNR-AGPL applies the accelerated proximal gradient line search method (APGL) for the final optimization. For TNNR-ADMMAP, we make use of an adaptive penalty according to a novel update rule for ADMM to achieve a faster convergence rate. Our empirical study shows encouraging results of the proposed algorithms in comparison to the state-of-the-art matrix completion algorithms on both synthetic and real visual datasets.},

abstract = {The traditional notion of generalization---i.e., learning a hypothesis whose empirical error is close to its true error---is surprisingly brittle. As has recently been noted in [DFH+15b], even if several algorithms have this guarantee in isolation, the guarantee need not hold if the algorithms are composed adaptively. In this paper, we study three notions of generalization---increasing in strength---that are robust to postprocessing and amenable to adaptive composition, and examine the relationships between them. We call the weakest such notion Robust Generalization. A second, intermediate, notion is the stability guarantee known as differential privacy. The strongest guarantee we consider we call Perfect Generalization. We prove that every hypothesis class that is PAC learnable is also PAC learnable in a robustly generalizing fashion, with almost the same sample complexity. It was previously known that differentially private algorithms satisfy robust generalization. In this paper, we show that robust generalization is a strictly weaker concept, and that there is a learning task that can be carried out subject to robust generalization guarantees, yet cannot be carried out subject to differential privacy. We also show that perfect generalization is a strictly stronger guarantee than differential privacy, but that, nevertheless, many learning tasks can be carried out subject to the guarantees of perfect generalization.},

abstract = {Betweenness is a measure of the centrality of a node in a network, and is normally calculated as the fraction of shortest paths between node pairs that pass through the node of interest. Betweenness is, in some sense, a measure of the influence a node has over the spread of information through the network. By counting only shortest paths, however, the conventional definition implicitly assumes that information spreads only along those shortest paths. Here, we propose a betweenness measure that relaxes this assumption, including contributions from essentially all paths between nodes, not just the shortest, although it still gives more weight to short paths. The measure is based on random walks, counting how often a node is traversed by a random walk between two other nodes. We show how our measure can be calculated using matrix methods, and give some examples of its application to particular networks. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

We provide computational bounds and a hardness result on the mul- tiplicative inapproximability of minimizing the difference between submodular functions.

Typically, this involves minimizing a surrogate objective, such as the negative log likelihood of a generative model, with the hope that representations useful for subsequent tasks will arise as a side effect. In this work, we propose instead to directly target later desired tasks by meta-learning an unsupervised learning rule which leads to representations useful for those tasks. Specifically, we target semi-supervised classification performance, and we meta-learn an algorithm -- an unsupervised weight update rule -- that produces representations useful for this task. Additionally, we constrain our unsupervised update rule to a be a biologically-motivated, neuron-local function, which enables it to generalize to different neural network architectures, datasets, and data modalities. We show that the meta-learned update rule produces useful features and sometimes outperforms existing unsupervised learning techniques. We further show that the meta-learned unsupervised update rule generalizes to train networks with different widths, depths, and nonlinearities. It also generalizes to train on data with randomly permuted input dimensions and even generalizes from image datasets to a text task.},

In this paper we present an incremental algorithm for a version of the grammar problem. As a special case of this algorithm we obtain an efficient incremental algorithm for the single-source shortest-path problem with positive edge lengths. The aspect of our work that distinguishes it from other work on the dynamic shortest-path problem is its ability to handle ''multiple heterogeneous modifications'': between updates, the input graph is allowed to be restructured by an arbitrary mixture of edge insertions, edge deletions, and edge-length changes.

We identified 36 overlapping regulons that were enriched for risk loci and formed a distinct cluster within the network, suggesting shared biology. The risk transcription factors driving these regulons are frequently mutated in cancer and lie in two opposing subgroups, which relate to estrogen receptor (ER) + luminal A or luminal B and ER {\^{a}} 'irc;' basal-like cancers and to different luminal epithelial cell populations in the adult mammary gland.

Previous work on information diffusion has focused on modeling the diffusion dynamics and selecting nodes to maximize/minimize influence. Only a paucity of recent studies have attempted to address the network modification problems, where the goal is to either facilitate desirable spreads or curtail undesirable ones by adding or deleting a small subset of network nodes or edges. In this paper, we focus on the widely studied linear threshold diffusion model, and prove, for the first time, that the network modification problems under this model have supermodular objective functions. This surprising property allows us to design efficient data structures and scalable algorithms with provable approximation guarantees, despite the hardness of the problems in question. Both the time and space complexities of our algorithms are linear in the size of the network, which allows us to experiment with millions of nodes and edges. We show that our algorithms outperform an array of heuristics in terms of their effectiveness in controlling diffusion processes, often beating the next best by a significant margin.},

abstract = {In this paper, we develop a formal framework for what a good community should look like and how strong a community is (community strength). One of the key innovations is to incorporate the concept of relative centrality into structural analysis of networks. In our framework, relative centrality is a measure that measures how important a set of nodes in a network is with respect to another set of nodes, and it is a generalization of centrality. Building on top of relative centrality, the community strength for a set of nodes is measured by the difference between its relative centrality with respect to itself and its centrality. A community is then a set of nodes with a nonnegative community strength. We show that our community strength is related to conductance that is commonly used for measuring the strength of a small community. We define the modularity for a partition of a network as the average community strength for a randomly selected node. Such a definition generalizes the original Newman's modularity and recovers the stability in as special cases. For the local community detection problem, we also develop efficient agglomerative algorithms that guarantee the community strength of the detected local community.},

Several GCN studies have been done in maize (Zea mays), mostly using microarray datasets. To build an optimal GCN from plant materials RNA-Seq data, parameters for expression data normalization and network inference were evaluated. A comprehensive evaluation of these two parameters and a ranked aggregation strategy on network performance, using libraries from 1266 maize samples, were conducted. Three normalization methods and 10 inference methods, including six correlation and four mutual information methods, were tested. The three normalization methods had very similar performance. For network inference, correlation methods performed better than mutual information methods at some genes. Increasing sample size also had a positive effect on GCN. Aggregating single networks together resulted in improved performance compared to single networks.},

Often, such problems can be posed as maximizing a submodular set function subject to a cardinality constraint. We consider this question in the streaming setting, where elements arrive over time at a fast pace and thus we need to design an efficient, lowmemory algorithm. One such method, proposed by Badanidiyuru et al. (2014), always finds a 0.5-approximate solution. Can this approximation factor be improved? We answer this question affirmatively by designing a new algorithm Salsa for streaming submodular maximization. It is the first low-memory, single-pass algorithm that improves the factor 0.5, under the natural assumption that elements arrive in a random order. We also show that this assumption is necessary, i.e., that there is no such algorithm with better than 0.5-approximation when elements arrive in arbitrary order. Our experiments demonstrate that salsa significantly outperforms the stale of the art in applications related to exemplar-based clustering, social graph analysis, and recommender systems.},

abstract = {At initialization, artificial neural networks (ANNs) are equivalent to Gaussian processes in the infinite-width limit, thus connecting them to kernel methods. We prove that the evolution of an ANN during training can also be described by a kernel: during gradient descent on the parameters of an ANN, the network function $f_\theta$ (which maps input vectors to output vectors) follows the kernel gradient of the functional cost (which is convex, in contrast to the parameter cost) w.r.t. a new kernel: the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK). This kernel is central to describe the generalization features of ANNs. While the NTK is random at initialization and varies during training, in the infinite-width limit it converges to an explicit limiting kernel and it stays constant during training. This makes it possible to study the training of ANNs in function space instead of parameter space. Convergence of the training can then be related to the positive-definiteness of the limiting NTK. We prove the positive-definiteness of the limiting NTK when the data is supported on the sphere and the non-linearity is non-polynomial. We then focus on the setting of least-squares regression and show that in the infinite-width limit, the network function $f_\theta$ follows a linear differential equation during training. The convergence is fastest along the largest kernel principal components of the input data with respect to the NTK, hence suggesting a theoretical motivation for early stopping. Finally we study the NTK numerically, observe its behavior for wide networks, and compare it to the infinite-width limit.},

This paper presents an optimization approach for identifying interdiction bounds with respect to connectivity and/or flow associated with a system of origins and destinations. Application results for telecommunications flow are presented, illustrating the capabilities of this approach. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {In recent years, researchers have investigated a growing number of weighted networks where ties are differentiated according to their strength or capacity. Yet, most network measures do not take weights into consideration, and thus do not fully capture the richness of the information contained in the data. In this paper, we focus on a measure originally defined for unweighted networks: the global clustering coefficient. We propose a generalization of this coefficient that retains the information encoded in the weights of ties. We then undertake a comparative assessment by applying the standard and generalized coefficients to a number of network datasets. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

To mitigate the risk and develop proactive responses, it is essential to assess the robustness of network in the worst-case scenarios. In this paper, we propose a spectral lower-bound on the number of removed links to incur a certain level of disruption in terms of pairwise connectivity. Our lower-bound explores the latent structural information in the network Laplacian spectrum, the set of eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix, to provide guarantees on the robustness of the network against intentional attacks. Such guarantees often cannot be found in heuristic methods for identifying critical infrastructures. For the first time, the attack-resistant proofs of large scale communication networks against link attacks are presented. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {Background: Typical human genome differs from the reference genome at 4-5 million sites. This diversity is increasingly catalogued in repositories such as ExAC/gnomAD, consisting of >15,000 whole-genomes and >126,000 exome sequences from different individuals. Despite this enormous diversity, resequencing data workflows are still based on a single human reference genome. Identification and genotyping of genetic variants is typically carried out on short-read data aligned to a single reference, disregarding the underlying variation. Results: We propose a new unified framework for variant calling with short-read data utilizing a representation of human genetic variation-a pan-genomic reference. We provide a modular pipeline that can be seamlessly incorporated into existing sequencing data analysis workflows. Our tool is open source and available online: https://gitlab.com/dvalenzu/PanVC. Conclusions: Our experiments show that by replacing a standard human reference with a pan-genomic one we achieve an improvement in single-nucleotide variant calling accuracy and in short indel calling accuracy over the widely adopted Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) in difficult genomic regions.},

@inproceedings{Novak2018,
abstract = {There is a previously identified equivalence between wide fully connected neural networks (FCNs) and Gaussian processes (GPs). This equivalence enables, for instance, test set predictions that would have resulted from a fully Bayesian, infinitely wide trained FCN to be computed without ever instantiating the FCN, but by instead evaluating the corresponding GP. In this work, we derive an analogous equivalence for multi-layer convolutional neural networks (CNNs) both with and without pooling layers, and achieve state of the art results on CIFAR10 for GPs without trainable kernels. We also introduce a Monte Carlo method to estimate the GP corresponding to a given neural network architecture, even in cases where the analytic form has too many terms to be computationally feasible. Surprisingly, in the absence of pooling layers, the GPs corresponding to CNNs with and without weight sharing are identical. As a consequence, translation equivariance, beneficial in finite channel CNNs trained with stochastic gradient descent (SGD), is guaranteed to play no role in the Bayesian treatment of the infinite channel limit - a qualitative difference between the two regimes that is not present in the FCN case. We confirm experimentally, that while in some scenarios the performance of SGD-trained finite CNNs approaches that of the corresponding GPs as the channel count increases, with careful tuning SGD-trained CNNs can significantly outperform their corresponding GPs, suggesting advantages from SGD training compared to fully Bayesian parameter estimation.},

We show that problems in these classes can be approximated with some bounded error. Furthermore, we show that a number of common optimization problems are complete for MAX SNP under a kind of careful transformation (called L-reduction) that preserves approximability. It follows that such a complete problem has a polynomial-time approximation scheme iff the whole class does. These results may help explain the lack of progress on the approximability of a host of optimization problems. ?? 1991.},

abstract = {The stochastic greedy algorithm (SG) is a randomized version of the greedy algorithm for submodular maximization with a size constraint. SG is highly practical since it is fast, delivers high empirical performance, and is easy to implement. However, its approximation guarantee has been proved only for monotone objective functions; this is natural since the original greedy algorithm is known to perform arbitrarily poorly for non-monotone objectives in general. In this paper, contrary to the expectation, we prove an interesting result: Thanks to the randomization, SG (with slight modification) can achieve almost $1/4$-approximation guarantees in expectation even for non-monotone objective functions. Our result provides practical and theoretically guaranteed algorithms for non-monotone submodular maximization with size a constraint, which run far faster and achieve as good objective values as existing algorithms.},

@inproceedings{Aguirre2013,
abstract = {Competitive interactions represent one of the driving forces behind evolution and natural selection in biological and sociological systems 1,2 . For example, animals in an ecosystem may vie for food or mates; in a market economy, firms may compete over the same group of customers; sensory stimuli may compete for limited neural resources to enter the focus of attention. Here, we derive rules based on the spectral properties of the network governing the competitive interactions between groups of agents organized in networks. In the scenario studied here the winner of the competition, and the time needed to prevail, essentially depend on the way a given network connects to its competitors and on its internal structure. Our results allow assessment of the extent to which real networks optimize the outcome of their interaction, but also provide strategies through which competing networks can improve on their situation. The proposed approach is applicable to a wide range of systems that can be modelled as networks 3 . Often, the outcome of a competitive process between agents is affected not only by their direct competitors but also by the specific network of connections in which they operate. Complex networks theory offers a large number of topological measures 3 , which can be derived in a simple way from the adjacency matrix G, containing the information on network connectivity. These measures can then be used to explain important dynamical and functional properties such as robustness 4,5 , synchronization 6 , spreading 7 or congestion 8,9 . Hitherto, the emphasis has been on the properties of single isolated networks. Typically, however, networks interact with other networks, while simultaneously retaining their original identity. Recently, a few studies have examined how global structural properties or dynamical processes are affected by the existence of connected networks, showing for instance that robustness 10–13 , synchronization 14 , cooperation 15,16 , transport 17 or epidemic spreading 18–21 change markedly when considering a network of networks 22 . Interestingly, although certain types of network interdependence may enhance vulnerability with respect to the case of isolated networks 10 , the addition of links between networks may also hinder cascading processes, such as failures in a power grid, on interconnected networks 23 . This holistic view requires a broad redefinition of classical network parameters 24 . Even more importantly, one of the major challenges lies in the identification of guidelines for how to best link networks 25 . If one considers the outcome of interaction from the perspective of a single network, which is either forced into or evaluates the benefits from interacting with another one, an important challenge arises: How can I make the most of my interaction with another network? To answer this question, we consider two separate networks competing for given limited resources, which in general are related to the structural properties of the network and to the outcome of a certain dynamical process. The two networks interact by creating common links, but retain their original identity.},

We provide the first approximation algorithm for this problem that takes into account error due to sampling; this error is bounded by the algorithm as a loss factor in the approximation ratio from sampling error. As building blocks, an extension of reverse influence sampling to partial influence and a novel polynomial-time algorithm for maximizing a weakly submodular, non-negative, and monotonic function on the integer lattice under an approximate oracle are used. The influence algorithm is validated by an experimental evaluation in which our algorithm is demonstrated to scale to large networks and outperforms all previous heuristics for this problem.},
